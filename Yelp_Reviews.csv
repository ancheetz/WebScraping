Christine Q.,"Toronto, ON",5/23/2019,5,"[""I've been here on multiple occasions with groups of 6 up to 30+ people. Bar + has been my choice for karaoke downtown since 2011. As a person that is constantly involved in choir, I enjoy singing, and I'm acquainted with a lot of people that enjoy singing, too. But even seasoned singers can get nervous in front of strangers, and that's why we opt for the privacy of the karaoke rooms of Bar +.First off, the location is very convenient for people who spend most of their time downtown and students. It's only steps away from the busy Dundas station, and a reasonable 20 minute walk away from the St. George campus. However, it might be hard to spot the blink-and-you'll-miss-it door to the stairs leading up to the 2nd floor establishment.There is a bar and a waiting area when you enter, so that you can get your liquid courage while you wait for the rest of your party. The beverage and snack prices are not super expensive. They do allow you to order food to be delivered right to your room.What really sets Bar + apart from other private karaoke bars downtown is how clean it is, and their MASSIVE song collection. I was also happily surprised by the updated tablet system and phone app. The app allows users to bookmark their favorite songs, search by song title and artist, and queue the song directly from the phone to the room via WiFi. No more fighting over the queuing remote! Additionally, they also have a collection of the most recent pop hits in their library, not to mention all the old classics. Finally, all the menus are in English, so finding that perfect song to show off your range will not be a challenge.""]"
