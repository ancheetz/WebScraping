Michael D.,"New York, NY",7/4/2020,5,"We ate there today, our first venture out during COVID. What a lovely late afternoon lunch. The sun was warm, we had a very nice table for two. The limited menu (who doesn't?) had Antipasti which was very tasty, loved the addition of anchovy. I had a cheeseburger and fries (don't laugh!) and it was delicious. They serve natural wines which I adore and I had a nice full bodied rose. They give you safety instructions as you sit down and the staff were as diligent as one can be. We felt extraordinarily safe. After this positive experience, there is no way in hel..I am going ""Inside"" a NYC restaurant and try to stay safe. Outstanding service too. Give this place some love, won't you?"
Chris M.,"Culver City, CA",2/20/2020,5,"Hi guys,We had dinner tonight and it was super amazing! The food was soooo delicious and the service was excellent. From the beginning of our evening, Lisa was super cordial (and funny) and Blaise (sp?) provided excellent guidance through our meal, including the wine.  5 star cudos to the chef and everyone on board...until next time."
Brian L.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",3/13/2020,3,"Starting to lose faith with the Michelin guide. From disappointments with Estela, Claro and now Horsemen, I'm starting to question the integrity and honesty with the Michelin system. Mussels. 6 is these things. Fresh and meaty with a nice citrus salsa on top. Nothing special. Salt cod fritters. Good but it's a fritter so you there isn't anything unexpected other than how average it is. Tuna crudo. It's served like a hanger steak. You need to cut it. Oil and cream on the bottom. Big slab of tuna on top. Wasn't a big fan of it. Asparagus dish was overpowered from the grated cheese and almonds. I barely tasted any asparagus since it was shaved thin. Pappardelle with lamb beck ragu was good but nothing a nice Italian place couldn't do. Nothing that I nor you wouldn't have had. Shrimp was very good. Probably my favorite thing of the night. Peppery with a good kick. A bunch of okay dishes that were fine but nothing really stood out. Dishes here change frequently so maybe I just went on a bad night."
Benjamin F.,"San Francisco, CA",12/20/2019,5,"A friend of mine recommended that we go to his favorite place in the neighborhood (The Four Horseman) and boy am I glad he loves this place because I now love it too. Conceptually perfect, this restaurants menu changes every week with a lovely little prefix three course lunch/dinner. The price for the food (see photos) was just over thirty bucks for our lunch and well worth it. I thought the pasta was so GD delicious that I'm still dreaming about it. The other dishes were well executed and perfect accompaniments but that pasta...hot damn. The coolest part of the place is easily the wine list. It's geeky, fun and there's something for everyone. The servers are super gracious in helping you select a great wine and will offer tastes of the btg list if you ask nicely. Bravo Four Horseman. See you again ASAP."
Daniel S.,"New York, NY",11/27/2019,4,"There's some people that you love to hate.  Aziz Ansari is one of those celebrities. He's borderline annoying, but still relatable and funny sometimes. You may have noticed this restaurant on his show Master of None, where he brings all his first dates. A newly minted Michelin star for 2019, The Four Horsemen is a wine bar / restaurant in Brooklyn. I usually never make my way to the BK, but my goal to collect all the stars in New York led me here and also hopes to see my boy Aziz. Resy's are extremely hard to get with their new star, so I recommend planning early if you want to eat here. The dining room is small.The menu is small and is split in three sections. Starters, raw/cured, and main pates.Starts--bread and cultured butter -- a must!! one of the best breads I've had--chicken liver mousse - loved this dish, the mousse was perfectly creamy and paired well with the chips they giveRaw / Cured-- spicy bonito - maine uni, rice and nori - was not bad, the uni gave this dish a creamy texture and it had a good spice. It was fun to make my little sushi pieces with the nori--montauk sea scallops - leche de tigre, daikon, fish sauce - extremely fresh scallops, and the sauce was really refreshingPlates--Potato gnocchi - puur ground fonduta, smoked mushroom, chives - prob my least fav of the night - flavors didn't really stand out to me - would pass--Grilled sasso chicken leg - koginut squash, brown butter - when the dish came out, it scared me with the chicken feet still on it lol. The miso glaze was amazing and the squash and brown butter was heavenly Dessert--Chocolate tart - not too sweet, loved the ice cream with it--Ginger Ice cream - not too gingery, good palate cleanser for the nightThe Four Hoursemen is a great spot for date night. It's a dim place and full of romance. Their wine list is huge as well. The service was excellent. It's pretty affordable too for the quality of food."
Sasha P.,"New York, NY",1/11/2020,5,"Had a great afternoon here to try some new wine, a cheese board and the prosciutto! We went in the early afternoon on a Saturday and we were able to sit right down-- we made a reservation but would've been fine without one. The service was laid back yet helpful and attentive when we had questions. The cheese with the jam was an incredible pairing along with the prosciutto- We'll definitely be back to try the dinner menu."
Reshard R.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/12/2019,5,"It finally happened. I was emotionally touched by food, service, and ambiance all at once. This gem on Grand has a Michelin star. At first you think its hype this star business until you realize that Chef is not playing with you. You are being dealt with in a manner appropriate for a foodie. ...and you like it."
Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",4/19/2019,3,"5 star service, 2 star food. I had seen and heard raving reviews of this place so I was excited to come here for dinner with a few of my girlfriends yesterday night. From the beginning, the service was impeccable. They were extremely understanding about moving our reservation a half hour later and were always there when when had a question or needed something. They even went to the cellar to get a bottle of white wine that my party wanted to drink unchilled.Unfortunately the food was not on par with the service. We started with the raw scallops which I found to be extremely fishy and flavorless. Next was the shrimp, which was flavorless and fishy as well. I found both to be unpleasant to eat. The crispy potatoes were the best dish of the night but.. how hard is it to mess up potatoes? We got a pasta dish as well which was fine but nothing to write home about. My biggest disappointment however was the frangipane tart. It was tough and the outer crust was burnt. You know that a dessert isn't good when 4 girls end up leaving some behind after a light dinner. The ambiance, service and wine was good but I doubt I would be back as I don't live in Brooklyn. My recommendation is to skip the food and stick to wine if you do go."
Risa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/3/2020,5,I've tried to get into this spot a few times and the one time I was lucky we just ordered a few glasses of wine (no food).  Service was great - really liked the waitress and we had a conversation of the plant on the window bar side. She was super friendly and knowledgeable about the wines on the menu.  Will be back for food+wine next time!
Liz S.,"New York, NY",1/30/2019,4,"Four Horsemen is a hipster small plates and wine bar in Williamsburg, differentiated from its peers largely by its appearance on Master of None and its ownership by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. However, its reputation has generally stood up to the hype, so I visited a few months ago with my boyfriend for a Friday date night.First off, this place is tiny. I had a shocking moment when we stood up to leave and I realized the other half of the room was actually a mirror. It seats probably 15 in the main room and less than 10 at the bar. For weekend prime time, you'll need to book about 4 weeks out-- less than a week is completely fine for weeknights or off times. They also take walk-ins at the bar, but there's not much room to wait and I wouldn't call it amazing odds. As it was, we were seated about 10 minutes after our reservation.The vibe is excellent. Decor is minimalist and well-considered; looks like the apartment you wish you had. Lighting is a bit dark for my taste but feels very cool. Music on point, naturally. Very loud-- don't expect heart-to-hearts here. Service is some of the best I've had in New York, a sort of chatty, conspiratorial effortlessness.The wine list is huge. Thankfully, unlike a lot of trendy wine bars (cough, Wildair), they offer a good amount by the glass so committing to a bottle isn't necessary to get to the cool stuff. And the staff, used to questions, is well-versed in the list. We had two different orange wines that were spot-on with our waiter's description.If you do go by the bottle, there's a wealth of options in the $50-80 range. The list overall leans French, with Italy, Spain, and the US well represented as well as some oddball countries. Natural and conventional seem to be mixed together. Mostly small producers. You'll spot some that are ubiquitous on the NYC natural scene (2Naturkinder) but many of the obvious (Scholium, Donkey and Goat) are omitted; I had a hard time recognizing many. Skin contact and sparkling are at the front, and seem to be pretty popular here. I also appreciated that they have ""new additions"" and ""end of the case"" sections.The food list is comparatively easier to navigate, though you may need more assistance from the excellent service on how much to order. We ended up doing two starters, one raw, and two plates for two people, and mildly overordered.We started with house bread and butter ($7), good and worth getting if you're going to be doing mostly raw options or small plates. Next up was la marotte ($12), a semi-firm sheep's milk cheese shaved into a frilly ruffle with jam and massive cracker. This was great, but would recommend capping your meal off with this instead.I totally forget what raw we ordered ($20ish), remember it being small and a little too clean-tasting for me. Black trumpet toast ($20) was nice but what ended up being most striking was the fried sage topping. Finally, we had lamb ribs ($30ish), which was a bit of a hassle; some good bites in here nestled among the fat and gristle, but a nice glaze.Overall, despite being not being overly impressed by the food, I enjoyed my time here. It's a sexy place and they're doing some exciting things here. There's a reason this was the backdrop for the succession of Aziz Ansari's first dates, though I'd recommend knowing your date a bit better than that given the cost and noise level. This is also clearly a wine lover's paradise, and I would love to dive into the list. I really wish there was more room here, lower prices, and a bit less popularity-- I would love for this to be my around-the-corner spot for a glass of wine and a snack."
Ryan F.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",8/7/2019,4,"Went to The Four Horsemen for dinner on Saturday night. A lively wine bar with good wine, solid food, and excellent music.Quality: Decided to share some wine and small plates for dinner. As we waited for a seat we ordered a nice red off the last call area of the menu. The wine list is long, but we felt confident in something that clearly caught the interest of others. Once we sat we focused in on the appetizers and raw dishes. We started with the flavorful Chicken Liver Mousse. Served with light crackers, it was a solid dish. Next came the Warm House Bread, which was tremendous. I am usually skeptical of bread that does not come complimentary, but it was so good we got a second order. Last was the Beef Tartare, which I was not crazy about. The texture was strange with the addition of seeds and I also did not like the sesame seed crackers it came with. However, it seemed like a hit as it sat in front of nearly everyone at the bar.Quantity: We stuck with starters and raw dishes, which are understandably smaller, but they also have full plates.Value: $12 for the Chicken Liver Mousse. $7 for the Warm House Bread. $16 for the Beef Tartare. Wines start at around $40.Ambiance: The Four Horsemen is located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg. The wine bar is a small and simple space. A few stools along the front window, a tiny square bar towards the center of the space, and then a collection of tables in the back. Throughout the space are additional pockets where guests waiting for a table can lean and put down their drinks. The music is great, which should not be too surprising considering James Murphy's involvement with the bar, but it will be played loud. This is not a wine bar for quiet conversation.Crowd: It is not a large space and it fills up quick. When we arrived we were told a twenty minute wait, which was pretty accurate. Be warned, as it is a wine bar, people tend to linger and the wait may be underestimated.Service: Appreciated that the staff took care of those waiting for a seat. We were offered drinks and food while still standing.Parking: Limited street parking throughout the area."
Jenny W.,"New York, NY",12/20/2019,5,"I understand the hype. Loved my dinner at this intimate, cozy wine bar located in an otherwise nondescript part of WillIamsburg. The bar was packed even at 5:30pm - which makes sense because reservations are so hard to come by. But if you just manage to plan 3-4 weeks in advance, you can snag a reservation at a prime time here and it's very much worth it. Perfect place to catch up with a friend or go with a date. The food was all excellent. The highlight to my surprise was actually the butter bean purée - think hummus like consistency but with a brightness and lightness from lemon juice and  mint / herbs that's distinctly not hummus like. Also got their famed bread (good but I wouldn't make it a point to order it), spicy Spanish mackerel (comes with uni and tastes like a hand roll), lamb pappardelle (thin strips of pappardelle with a delicious and savory lamb make this dish lighter than I would have expected). Ended with the chocolate pine nut tart (with espresso cream) which was very rich and chocolate-y (not a must get, but enjoyable if you want to end on a sweet note)."
Tony R.,"Manhattan, NY",12/23/2019,4,"For brunch the food and price here are great.  $35 for three courses set menu.  Service is good.  The beef bourguignon, salad, and dessert were all very good.  Dinner is not a set menu, and I would be eager to return."
Meadow L.,"Chicago, IL",3/26/2020,4,This place is great. Great wines at reasonable prices. The food is always top notch. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. What more could you want
Tran T.,"Long Island, NY",11/12/2019,3,"My husband was dying to come here for his birthday and so I obliged. I emailed them ahead of time to see if I could add something special for the occasion to which they offered a candle with whichever dessert we wanted and noted the reservation... perfect! The bread and butter was the best part of our meal while the other dishes were not memorable. Service was impeccable... but they forgot about my husband's birthday. Just before I was going to point it out, our waitress came back with the wine we had been drinking and apologized for not seeing the note sooner and offered us 2 glasses on the house, so they made it right! The bill was a hefty $300 and the food was unfortunately nothing to write home about."
Steph C.,"New York, NY",3/12/2020,3,Chicken liver mousse was stellar. Excellent wine list. A few overpriced dishes. The rhubarb galette was good but not worth $15.
Liz W.,"New York, NY",3/2/2020,1,"The rudest service I've ever encountered in NYC, and I've lived here for almost 20 years. I went on a Saturday night, and it was packed - which was expected, considering the hype. The host informed me that she wasn't taking names, it would be an hour wait, and there was no space to wait, so she wasn't sure how I was going to handle that. In not so many words, she told me to leave. It's such a turn off when there's a host on a power trip for no reason - and ESPECIALLY in Williamsburg, there are many more places that can take my money. I will never set foot in this place again."
Edward J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/21/2019,5,"Delightful, simply executed and well constructed plates, think a bowl of perfect cherry tomatoes and a dollop of garlicky aioli, a plate of charred scallions with earthy squash and peppery pecorino, or a almond semifreddo with olive oil and flaky salt. The weekend lunch is kind of perfect. I love that they give you the time and the space to lounge away, get a couple of glasses of wine and enjoy the company. And the wine is great -- a lot of depth here. The service is warm and inviting. One of the best spots in the city and the perfect way to spend a weekend afternoon."
Ellyn M.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/14/2019,5,"I tell no lies when I say this is my actual favorite restaurant. One time I had a pea dish here so good that it made me cry. Twice.The menu is rotating, but you can't go wrong with the staples: bread and butter, raw scallops, steak tartare.The servers here are the most knowledgeable and friendly wine-os I've ever encountered.Their weekend lunch coursed meal is the crown on the very obviously king that is this restaurant. I've been here about 15 times and each time the flavors remain delicious and consistent. Keep doing what you're doing, Four Horsemen, and I will forever be your longing admirer."
Stefan H.,"New York, NY",3/1/2020,5,"The Four Horsemen is as good a restaurant as it is a wine bar. Regarding the food, there are no wrong choices. The Mackerel, the tuna, and home-made sausage are just as good as the cabbage, the fava beans and the asparagus. There are no wrong answers and the waiter will help you pick out a wine that goes perfectly with the meal"

Meadow L.,"Chicago, IL",3/26/2020,4,This place is great. Great wines at reasonable prices. The food is always top notch. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. What more could you want
Tran T.,"Long Island, NY",11/12/2019,3,"My husband was dying to come here for his birthday and so I obliged. I emailed them ahead of time to see if I could add something special for the occasion to which they offered a candle with whichever dessert we wanted and noted the reservation... perfect! The bread and butter was the best part of our meal while the other dishes were not memorable. Service was impeccable... but they forgot about my husband's birthday. Just before I was going to point it out, our waitress came back with the wine we had been drinking and apologized for not seeing the note sooner and offered us 2 glasses on the house, so they made it right! The bill was a hefty $300 and the food was unfortunately nothing to write home about."
Steph C.,"New York, NY",3/12/2020,3,Chicken liver mousse was stellar. Excellent wine list. A few overpriced dishes. The rhubarb galette was good but not worth $15.
Liz W.,"New York, NY",3/2/2020,1,"The rudest service I've ever encountered in NYC, and I've lived here for almost 20 years. I went on a Saturday night, and it was packed - which was expected, considering the hype. The host informed me that she wasn't taking names, it would be an hour wait, and there was no space to wait, so she wasn't sure how I was going to handle that. In not so many words, she told me to leave. It's such a turn off when there's a host on a power trip for no reason - and ESPECIALLY in Williamsburg, there are many more places that can take my money. I will never set foot in this place again."
Edward J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/21/2019,5,"Delightful, simply executed and well constructed plates, think a bowl of perfect cherry tomatoes and a dollop of garlicky aioli, a plate of charred scallions with earthy squash and peppery pecorino, or a almond semifreddo with olive oil and flaky salt. The weekend lunch is kind of perfect. I love that they give you the time and the space to lounge away, get a couple of glasses of wine and enjoy the company. And the wine is great -- a lot of depth here. The service is warm and inviting. One of the best spots in the city and the perfect way to spend a weekend afternoon."
Ellyn M.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/14/2019,5,"I tell no lies when I say this is my actual favorite restaurant. One time I had a pea dish here so good that it made me cry. Twice.The menu is rotating, but you can't go wrong with the staples: bread and butter, raw scallops, steak tartare.The servers here are the most knowledgeable and friendly wine-os I've ever encountered.Their weekend lunch coursed meal is the crown on the very obviously king that is this restaurant. I've been here about 15 times and each time the flavors remain delicious and consistent. Keep doing what you're doing, Four Horsemen, and I will forever be your longing admirer."
Stefan H.,"New York, NY",3/1/2020,5,"The Four Horsemen is as good a restaurant as it is a wine bar. Regarding the food, there are no wrong choices. The Mackerel, the tuna, and home-made sausage are just as good as the cabbage, the fava beans and the asparagus. There are no wrong answers and the waiter will help you pick out a wine that goes perfectly with the meal"
Michael D.,"New York, NY",7/4/2020,5,"We ate there today, our first venture out during COVID. What a lovely late afternoon lunch. The sun was warm, we had a very nice table for two. The limited menu (who doesn't?) had Antipasti which was very tasty, loved the addition of anchovy. I had a cheeseburger and fries (don't laugh!) and it was delicious. They serve natural wines which I adore and I had a nice full bodied rose. They give you safety instructions as you sit down and the staff were as diligent as one can be. We felt extraordinarily safe. After this positive experience, there is no way in hel..I am going ""Inside"" a NYC restaurant and try to stay safe. Outstanding service too. Give this place some love, won't you?"
Chris M.,"Culver City, CA",2/20/2020,5,"Hi guys,We had dinner tonight and it was super amazing! The food was soooo delicious and the service was excellent. From the beginning of our evening, Lisa was super cordial (and funny) and Blaise (sp?) provided excellent guidance through our meal, including the wine.  5 star cudos to the chef and everyone on board...until next time."
Brian L.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",3/13/2020,3,"Starting to lose faith with the Michelin guide. From disappointments with Estela, Claro and now Horsemen, I'm starting to question the integrity and honesty with the Michelin system. Mussels. 6 is these things. Fresh and meaty with a nice citrus salsa on top. Nothing special. Salt cod fritters. Good but it's a fritter so you there isn't anything unexpected other than how average it is. Tuna crudo. It's served like a hanger steak. You need to cut it. Oil and cream on the bottom. Big slab of tuna on top. Wasn't a big fan of it. Asparagus dish was overpowered from the grated cheese and almonds. I barely tasted any asparagus since it was shaved thin. Pappardelle with lamb beck ragu was good but nothing a nice Italian place couldn't do. Nothing that I nor you wouldn't have had. Shrimp was very good. Probably my favorite thing of the night. Peppery with a good kick. A bunch of okay dishes that were fine but nothing really stood out. Dishes here change frequently so maybe I just went on a bad night."
Benjamin F.,"San Francisco, CA",12/20/2019,5,"A friend of mine recommended that we go to his favorite place in the neighborhood (The Four Horseman) and boy am I glad he loves this place because I now love it too. Conceptually perfect, this restaurants menu changes every week with a lovely little prefix three course lunch/dinner. The price for the food (see photos) was just over thirty bucks for our lunch and well worth it. I thought the pasta was so GD delicious that I'm still dreaming about it. The other dishes were well executed and perfect accompaniments but that pasta...hot damn. The coolest part of the place is easily the wine list. It's geeky, fun and there's something for everyone. The servers are super gracious in helping you select a great wine and will offer tastes of the btg list if you ask nicely. Bravo Four Horseman. See you again ASAP."
Daniel S.,"New York, NY",11/27/2019,4,"There's some people that you love to hate.  Aziz Ansari is one of those celebrities. He's borderline annoying, but still relatable and funny sometimes. You may have noticed this restaurant on his show Master of None, where he brings all his first dates. A newly minted Michelin star for 2019, The Four Horsemen is a wine bar / restaurant in Brooklyn. I usually never make my way to the BK, but my goal to collect all the stars in New York led me here and also hopes to see my boy Aziz. Resy's are extremely hard to get with their new star, so I recommend planning early if you want to eat here. The dining room is small.The menu is small and is split in three sections. Starters, raw/cured, and main pates.Starts--bread and cultured butter -- a must!! one of the best breads I've had--chicken liver mousse - loved this dish, the mousse was perfectly creamy and paired well with the chips they giveRaw / Cured-- spicy bonito - maine uni, rice and nori - was not bad, the uni gave this dish a creamy texture and it had a good spice. It was fun to make my little sushi pieces with the nori--montauk sea scallops - leche de tigre, daikon, fish sauce - extremely fresh scallops, and the sauce was really refreshingPlates--Potato gnocchi - puur ground fonduta, smoked mushroom, chives - prob my least fav of the night - flavors didn't really stand out to me - would pass--Grilled sasso chicken leg - koginut squash, brown butter - when the dish came out, it scared me with the chicken feet still on it lol. The miso glaze was amazing and the squash and brown butter was heavenly Dessert--Chocolate tart - not too sweet, loved the ice cream with it--Ginger Ice cream - not too gingery, good palate cleanser for the nightThe Four Hoursemen is a great spot for date night. It's a dim place and full of romance. Their wine list is huge as well. The service was excellent. It's pretty affordable too for the quality of food."
Sasha P.,"New York, NY",1/11/2020,5,"Had a great afternoon here to try some new wine, a cheese board and the prosciutto! We went in the early afternoon on a Saturday and we were able to sit right down-- we made a reservation but would've been fine without one. The service was laid back yet helpful and attentive when we had questions. The cheese with the jam was an incredible pairing along with the prosciutto- We'll definitely be back to try the dinner menu."
Reshard R.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/12/2019,5,"It finally happened. I was emotionally touched by food, service, and ambiance all at once. This gem on Grand has a Michelin star. At first you think its hype this star business until you realize that Chef is not playing with you. You are being dealt with in a manner appropriate for a foodie. ...and you like it."
Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",4/19/2019,3,"5 star service, 2 star food. I had seen and heard raving reviews of this place so I was excited to come here for dinner with a few of my girlfriends yesterday night. From the beginning, the service was impeccable. They were extremely understanding about moving our reservation a half hour later and were always there when when had a question or needed something. They even went to the cellar to get a bottle of white wine that my party wanted to drink unchilled.Unfortunately the food was not on par with the service. We started with the raw scallops which I found to be extremely fishy and flavorless. Next was the shrimp, which was flavorless and fishy as well. I found both to be unpleasant to eat. The crispy potatoes were the best dish of the night but.. how hard is it to mess up potatoes? We got a pasta dish as well which was fine but nothing to write home about. My biggest disappointment however was the frangipane tart. It was tough and the outer crust was burnt. You know that a dessert isn't good when 4 girls end up leaving some behind after a light dinner. The ambiance, service and wine was good but I doubt I would be back as I don't live in Brooklyn. My recommendation is to skip the food and stick to wine if you do go."
Risa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/3/2020,5,I've tried to get into this spot a few times and the one time I was lucky we just ordered a few glasses of wine (no food).  Service was great - really liked the waitress and we had a conversation of the plant on the window bar side. She was super friendly and knowledgeable about the wines on the menu.  Will be back for food+wine next time!
Liz S.,"New York, NY",1/30/2019,4,"Four Horsemen is a hipster small plates and wine bar in Williamsburg, differentiated from its peers largely by its appearance on Master of None and its ownership by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. However, its reputation has generally stood up to the hype, so I visited a few months ago with my boyfriend for a Friday date night.First off, this place is tiny. I had a shocking moment when we stood up to leave and I realized the other half of the room was actually a mirror. It seats probably 15 in the main room and less than 10 at the bar. For weekend prime time, you'll need to book about 4 weeks out-- less than a week is completely fine for weeknights or off times. They also take walk-ins at the bar, but there's not much room to wait and I wouldn't call it amazing odds. As it was, we were seated about 10 minutes after our reservation.The vibe is excellent. Decor is minimalist and well-considered; looks like the apartment you wish you had. Lighting is a bit dark for my taste but feels very cool. Music on point, naturally. Very loud-- don't expect heart-to-hearts here. Service is some of the best I've had in New York, a sort of chatty, conspiratorial effortlessness.The wine list is huge. Thankfully, unlike a lot of trendy wine bars (cough, Wildair), they offer a good amount by the glass so committing to a bottle isn't necessary to get to the cool stuff. And the staff, used to questions, is well-versed in the list. We had two different orange wines that were spot-on with our waiter's description.If you do go by the bottle, there's a wealth of options in the $50-80 range. The list overall leans French, with Italy, Spain, and the US well represented as well as some oddball countries. Natural and conventional seem to be mixed together. Mostly small producers. You'll spot some that are ubiquitous on the NYC natural scene (2Naturkinder) but many of the obvious (Scholium, Donkey and Goat) are omitted; I had a hard time recognizing many. Skin contact and sparkling are at the front, and seem to be pretty popular here. I also appreciated that they have ""new additions"" and ""end of the case"" sections.The food list is comparatively easier to navigate, though you may need more assistance from the excellent service on how much to order. We ended up doing two starters, one raw, and two plates for two people, and mildly overordered.We started with house bread and butter ($7), good and worth getting if you're going to be doing mostly raw options or small plates. Next up was la marotte ($12), a semi-firm sheep's milk cheese shaved into a frilly ruffle with jam and massive cracker. This was great, but would recommend capping your meal off with this instead.I totally forget what raw we ordered ($20ish), remember it being small and a little too clean-tasting for me. Black trumpet toast ($20) was nice but what ended up being most striking was the fried sage topping. Finally, we had lamb ribs ($30ish), which was a bit of a hassle; some good bites in here nestled among the fat and gristle, but a nice glaze.Overall, despite being not being overly impressed by the food, I enjoyed my time here. It's a sexy place and they're doing some exciting things here. There's a reason this was the backdrop for the succession of Aziz Ansari's first dates, though I'd recommend knowing your date a bit better than that given the cost and noise level. This is also clearly a wine lover's paradise, and I would love to dive into the list. I really wish there was more room here, lower prices, and a bit less popularity-- I would love for this to be my around-the-corner spot for a glass of wine and a snack."
Ryan F.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",8/7/2019,4,"Went to The Four Horsemen for dinner on Saturday night. A lively wine bar with good wine, solid food, and excellent music.Quality: Decided to share some wine and small plates for dinner. As we waited for a seat we ordered a nice red off the last call area of the menu. The wine list is long, but we felt confident in something that clearly caught the interest of others. Once we sat we focused in on the appetizers and raw dishes. We started with the flavorful Chicken Liver Mousse. Served with light crackers, it was a solid dish. Next came the Warm House Bread, which was tremendous. I am usually skeptical of bread that does not come complimentary, but it was so good we got a second order. Last was the Beef Tartare, which I was not crazy about. The texture was strange with the addition of seeds and I also did not like the sesame seed crackers it came with. However, it seemed like a hit as it sat in front of nearly everyone at the bar.Quantity: We stuck with starters and raw dishes, which are understandably smaller, but they also have full plates.Value: $12 for the Chicken Liver Mousse. $7 for the Warm House Bread. $16 for the Beef Tartare. Wines start at around $40.Ambiance: The Four Horsemen is located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg. The wine bar is a small and simple space. A few stools along the front window, a tiny square bar towards the center of the space, and then a collection of tables in the back. Throughout the space are additional pockets where guests waiting for a table can lean and put down their drinks. The music is great, which should not be too surprising considering James Murphy's involvement with the bar, but it will be played loud. This is not a wine bar for quiet conversation.Crowd: It is not a large space and it fills up quick. When we arrived we were told a twenty minute wait, which was pretty accurate. Be warned, as it is a wine bar, people tend to linger and the wait may be underestimated.Service: Appreciated that the staff took care of those waiting for a seat. We were offered drinks and food while still standing.Parking: Limited street parking throughout the area."
Jenny W.,"New York, NY",12/20/2019,5,"I understand the hype. Loved my dinner at this intimate, cozy wine bar located in an otherwise nondescript part of WillIamsburg. The bar was packed even at 5:30pm - which makes sense because reservations are so hard to come by. But if you just manage to plan 3-4 weeks in advance, you can snag a reservation at a prime time here and it's very much worth it. Perfect place to catch up with a friend or go with a date. The food was all excellent. The highlight to my surprise was actually the butter bean purée - think hummus like consistency but with a brightness and lightness from lemon juice and  mint / herbs that's distinctly not hummus like. Also got their famed bread (good but I wouldn't make it a point to order it), spicy Spanish mackerel (comes with uni and tastes like a hand roll), lamb pappardelle (thin strips of pappardelle with a delicious and savory lamb make this dish lighter than I would have expected). Ended with the chocolate pine nut tart (with espresso cream) which was very rich and chocolate-y (not a must get, but enjoyable if you want to end on a sweet note)."

There's a reason this was the backdrop for the succession of Aziz Ansari's first dates, though I'd recommend knowing your date a bit better than that given the cost and noise level. This is also clearly a wine lover's paradise, and I would love to dive into the list. I really wish there was more room here, lower prices, and a bit less popularity-- I would love for this to be my around-the-corner spot for a glass of wine and a snack."
Ryan F.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",8/7/2019,4,"Went to The Four Horsemen for dinner on Saturday night. A lively wine bar with good wine, solid food, and excellent music.Quality: Decided to share some wine and small plates for dinner. As we waited for a seat we ordered a nice red off the last call area of the menu. The wine list is long, but we felt confident in something that clearly caught the interest of others. Once we sat we focused in on the appetizers and raw dishes. We started with the flavorful Chicken Liver Mousse. Served with light crackers, it was a solid dish. Next came the Warm House Bread, which was tremendous. I am usually skeptical of bread that does not come complimentary, but it was so good we got a second order. Last was the Beef Tartare, which I was not crazy about. The texture was strange with the addition of seeds and I also did not like the sesame seed crackers it came with. However, it seemed like a hit as it sat in front of nearly everyone at the bar.Quantity: We stuck with starters and raw dishes, which are understandably smaller, but they also have full plates.Value: $12 for the Chicken Liver Mousse. $7 for the Warm House Bread. $16 for the Beef Tartare. Wines start at around $40.Ambiance: The Four Horsemen is located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg. The wine bar is a small and simple space. A few stools along the front window, a tiny square bar towards the center of the space, and then a collection of tables in the back. Throughout the space are additional pockets where guests waiting for a table can lean and put down their drinks. The music is great, which should not be too surprising considering James Murphy's involvement with the bar, but it will be played loud. This is not a wine bar for quiet conversation.Crowd: It is not a large space and it fills up quick. When we arrived we were told a twenty minute wait, which was pretty accurate. Be warned, as it is a wine bar, people tend to linger and the wait may be underestimated.Service: Appreciated that the staff took care of those waiting for a seat. We were offered drinks and food while still standing.Parking: Limited street parking throughout the area."
Jenny W.,"New York, NY",12/20/2019,5,"I understand the hype. Loved my dinner at this intimate, cozy wine bar located in an otherwise nondescript part of WillIamsburg. The bar was packed even at 5:30pm - which makes sense because reservations are so hard to come by. But if you just manage to plan 3-4 weeks in advance, you can snag a reservation at a prime time here and it's very much worth it. Perfect place to catch up with a friend or go with a date. The food was all excellent. The highlight to my surprise was actually the butter bean purée - think hummus like consistency but with a brightness and lightness from lemon juice and  mint / herbs that's distinctly not hummus like. Also got their famed bread (good but I wouldn't make it a point to order it), spicy Spanish mackerel (comes with uni and tastes like a hand roll), lamb pappardelle (thin strips of pappardelle with a delicious and savory lamb make this dish lighter than I would have expected). Ended with the chocolate pine nut tart (with espresso cream) which was very rich and chocolate-y (not a must get, but enjoyable if you want to end on a sweet note)."
Tony R.,"Manhattan, NY",12/23/2019,4,"For brunch the food and price here are great.  $35 for three courses set menu.  Service is good.  The beef bourguignon, salad, and dessert were all very good.  Dinner is not a set menu, and I would be eager to return."
Meadow L.,"Chicago, IL",3/26/2020,4,This place is great. Great wines at reasonable prices. The food is always top notch. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. What more could you want
Tran T.,"Long Island, NY",11/12/2019,3,"My husband was dying to come here for his birthday and so I obliged. I emailed them ahead of time to see if I could add something special for the occasion to which they offered a candle with whichever dessert we wanted and noted the reservation... perfect! The bread and butter was the best part of our meal while the other dishes were not memorable. Service was impeccable... but they forgot about my husband's birthday. Just before I was going to point it out, our waitress came back with the wine we had been drinking and apologized for not seeing the note sooner and offered us 2 glasses on the house, so they made it right! The bill was a hefty $300 and the food was unfortunately nothing to write home about."
Steph C.,"New York, NY",3/12/2020,3,Chicken liver mousse was stellar. Excellent wine list. A few overpriced dishes. The rhubarb galette was good but not worth $15.
Liz W.,"New York, NY",3/2/2020,1,"The rudest service I've ever encountered in NYC, and I've lived here for almost 20 years. I went on a Saturday night, and it was packed - which was expected, considering the hype. The host informed me that she wasn't taking names, it would be an hour wait, and there was no space to wait, so she wasn't sure how I was going to handle that. In not so many words, she told me to leave. It's such a turn off when there's a host on a power trip for no reason - and ESPECIALLY in Williamsburg, there are many more places that can take my money. I will never set foot in this place again."
Edward J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/21/2019,5,"Delightful, simply executed and well constructed plates, think a bowl of perfect cherry tomatoes and a dollop of garlicky aioli, a plate of charred scallions with earthy squash and peppery pecorino, or a almond semifreddo with olive oil and flaky salt. The weekend lunch is kind of perfect. I love that they give you the time and the space to lounge away, get a couple of glasses of wine and enjoy the company. And the wine is great -- a lot of depth here. The service is warm and inviting. One of the best spots in the city and the perfect way to spend a weekend afternoon."
Ellyn M.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/14/2019,5,"I tell no lies when I say this is my actual favorite restaurant. One time I had a pea dish here so good that it made me cry. Twice.The menu is rotating, but you can't go wrong with the staples: bread and butter, raw scallops, steak tartare.The servers here are the most knowledgeable and friendly wine-os I've ever encountered.Their weekend lunch coursed meal is the crown on the very obviously king that is this restaurant. I've been here about 15 times and each time the flavors remain delicious and consistent. Keep doing what you're doing, Four Horsemen, and I will forever be your longing admirer."
Stefan H.,"New York, NY",3/1/2020,5,"The Four Horsemen is as good a restaurant as it is a wine bar. Regarding the food, there are no wrong choices. The Mackerel, the tuna, and home-made sausage are just as good as the cabbage, the fava beans and the asparagus. There are no wrong answers and the waiter will help you pick out a wine that goes perfectly with the meal"
Michael D.,"New York, NY",7/4/2020,5,"We ate there today, our first venture out during COVID. What a lovely late afternoon lunch. The sun was warm, we had a very nice table for two. The limited menu (who doesn't?) had Antipasti which was very tasty, loved the addition of anchovy. I had a cheeseburger and fries (don't laugh!) and it was delicious. They serve natural wines which I adore and I had a nice full bodied rose. They give you safety instructions as you sit down and the staff were as diligent as one can be. We felt extraordinarily safe. After this positive experience, there is no way in hel..I am going ""Inside"" a NYC restaurant and try to stay safe. Outstanding service too. Give this place some love, won't you?"
Chris M.,"Culver City, CA",2/20/2020,5,"Hi guys,We had dinner tonight and it was super amazing! The food was soooo delicious and the service was excellent. From the beginning of our evening, Lisa was super cordial (and funny) and Blaise (sp?) provided excellent guidance through our meal, including the wine.  5 star cudos to the chef and everyone on board...until next time."
Brian L.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",3/13/2020,3,"Starting to lose faith with the Michelin guide. From disappointments with Estela, Claro and now Horsemen, I'm starting to question the integrity and honesty with the Michelin system. Mussels. 6 is these things. Fresh and meaty with a nice citrus salsa on top. Nothing special. Salt cod fritters. Good but it's a fritter so you there isn't anything unexpected other than how average it is. Tuna crudo. It's served like a hanger steak. You need to cut it. Oil and cream on the bottom. Big slab of tuna on top. Wasn't a big fan of it. Asparagus dish was overpowered from the grated cheese and almonds. I barely tasted any asparagus since it was shaved thin. Pappardelle with lamb beck ragu was good but nothing a nice Italian place couldn't do. Nothing that I nor you wouldn't have had. Shrimp was very good. Probably my favorite thing of the night. Peppery with a good kick. A bunch of okay dishes that were fine but nothing really stood out. Dishes here change frequently so maybe I just went on a bad night."
Benjamin F.,"San Francisco, CA",12/20/2019,5,"A friend of mine recommended that we go to his favorite place in the neighborhood (The Four Horseman) and boy am I glad he loves this place because I now love it too. Conceptually perfect, this restaurants menu changes every week with a lovely little prefix three course lunch/dinner. The price for the food (see photos) was just over thirty bucks for our lunch and well worth it. I thought the pasta was so GD delicious that I'm still dreaming about it. The other dishes were well executed and perfect accompaniments but that pasta...hot damn. The coolest part of the place is easily the wine list. It's geeky, fun and there's something for everyone. The servers are super gracious in helping you select a great wine and will offer tastes of the btg list if you ask nicely. Bravo Four Horseman. See you again ASAP."
Daniel S.,"New York, NY",11/27/2019,4,"There's some people that you love to hate.  Aziz Ansari is one of those celebrities. He's borderline annoying, but still relatable and funny sometimes. You may have noticed this restaurant on his show Master of None, where he brings all his first dates. A newly minted Michelin star for 2019, The Four Horsemen is a wine bar / restaurant in Brooklyn. I usually never make my way to the BK, but my goal to collect all the stars in New York led me here and also hopes to see my boy Aziz. Resy's are extremely hard to get with their new star, so I recommend planning early if you want to eat here. The dining room is small.The menu is small and is split in three sections. Starters, raw/cured, and main pates.Starts--bread and cultured butter -- a must!! one of the best breads I've had--chicken liver mousse - loved this dish, the mousse was perfectly creamy and paired well with the chips they giveRaw / Cured-- spicy bonito - maine uni, rice and nori - was not bad, the uni gave this dish a creamy texture and it had a good spice. It was fun to make my little sushi pieces with the nori--montauk sea scallops - leche de tigre, daikon, fish sauce - extremely fresh scallops, and the sauce was really refreshingPlates--Potato gnocchi - puur ground fonduta, smoked mushroom, chives - prob my least fav of the night - flavors didn't really stand out to me - would pass--Grilled sasso chicken leg - koginut squash, brown butter - when the dish came out, it scared me with the chicken feet still on it lol. The miso glaze was amazing and the squash and brown butter was heavenly Dessert--Chocolate tart - not too sweet, loved the ice cream with it--Ginger Ice cream - not too gingery, good palate cleanser for the nightThe Four Hoursemen is a great spot for date night. It's a dim place and full of romance. Their wine list is huge as well. The service was excellent. It's pretty affordable too for the quality of food."
Sasha P.,"New York, NY",1/11/2020,5,"Had a great afternoon here to try some new wine, a cheese board and the prosciutto! We went in the early afternoon on a Saturday and we were able to sit right down-- we made a reservation but would've been fine without one. The service was laid back yet helpful and attentive when we had questions. The cheese with the jam was an incredible pairing along with the prosciutto- We'll definitely be back to try the dinner menu."
Reshard R.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/12/2019,5,"It finally happened. I was emotionally touched by food, service, and ambiance all at once. This gem on Grand has a Michelin star.

Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",4/19/2019,3,"5 star service, 2 star food. I had seen and heard raving reviews of this place so I was excited to come here for dinner with a few of my girlfriends yesterday night. From the beginning, the service was impeccable. They were extremely understanding about moving our reservation a half hour later and were always there when when had a question or needed something. They even went to the cellar to get a bottle of white wine that my party wanted to drink unchilled.Unfortunately the food was not on par with the service. We started with the raw scallops which I found to be extremely fishy and flavorless. Next was the shrimp, which was flavorless and fishy as well. I found both to be unpleasant to eat. The crispy potatoes were the best dish of the night but.. how hard is it to mess up potatoes? We got a pasta dish as well which was fine but nothing to write home about. My biggest disappointment however was the frangipane tart. It was tough and the outer crust was burnt. You know that a dessert isn't good when 4 girls end up leaving some behind after a light dinner. The ambiance, service and wine was good but I doubt I would be back as I don't live in Brooklyn. My recommendation is to skip the food and stick to wine if you do go."
Risa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/3/2020,5,I've tried to get into this spot a few times and the one time I was lucky we just ordered a few glasses of wine (no food).  Service was great - really liked the waitress and we had a conversation of the plant on the window bar side. She was super friendly and knowledgeable about the wines on the menu.  Will be back for food+wine next time!
Liz S.,"New York, NY",1/30/2019,4,"Four Horsemen is a hipster small plates and wine bar in Williamsburg, differentiated from its peers largely by its appearance on Master of None and its ownership by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. However, its reputation has generally stood up to the hype, so I visited a few months ago with my boyfriend for a Friday date night.First off, this place is tiny. I had a shocking moment when we stood up to leave and I realized the other half of the room was actually a mirror. It seats probably 15 in the main room and less than 10 at the bar. For weekend prime time, you'll need to book about 4 weeks out-- less than a week is completely fine for weeknights or off times. They also take walk-ins at the bar, but there's not much room to wait and I wouldn't call it amazing odds. As it was, we were seated about 10 minutes after our reservation.The vibe is excellent. Decor is minimalist and well-considered; looks like the apartment you wish you had. Lighting is a bit dark for my taste but feels very cool. Music on point, naturally. Very loud-- don't expect heart-to-hearts here. Service is some of the best I've had in New York, a sort of chatty, conspiratorial effortlessness.The wine list is huge. Thankfully, unlike a lot of trendy wine bars (cough, Wildair), they offer a good amount by the glass so committing to a bottle isn't necessary to get to the cool stuff. And the staff, used to questions, is well-versed in the list. We had two different orange wines that were spot-on with our waiter's description.If you do go by the bottle, there's a wealth of options in the $50-80 range. The list overall leans French, with Italy, Spain, and the US well represented as well as some oddball countries. Natural and conventional seem to be mixed together. Mostly small producers. You'll spot some that are ubiquitous on the NYC natural scene (2Naturkinder) but many of the obvious (Scholium, Donkey and Goat) are omitted; I had a hard time recognizing many. Skin contact and sparkling are at the front, and seem to be pretty popular here. I also appreciated that they have ""new additions"" and ""end of the case"" sections.The food list is comparatively easier to navigate, though you may need more assistance from the excellent service on how much to order. We ended up doing two starters, one raw, and two plates for two people, and mildly overordered.We started with house bread and butter ($7), good and worth getting if you're going to be doing mostly raw options or small plates. Next up was la marotte ($12), a semi-firm sheep's milk cheese shaved into a frilly ruffle with jam and massive cracker. This was great, but would recommend capping your meal off with this instead.I totally forget what raw we ordered ($20ish), remember it being small and a little too clean-tasting for me. Black trumpet toast ($20) was nice but what ended up being most striking was the fried sage topping. Finally, we had lamb ribs ($30ish), which was a bit of a hassle; some good bites in here nestled among the fat and gristle, but a nice glaze.Overall, despite being not being overly impressed by the food, I enjoyed my time here. It's a sexy place and they're doing some exciting things here. There's a reason this was the backdrop for the succession of Aziz Ansari's first dates, though I'd recommend knowing your date a bit better than that given the cost and noise level. This is also clearly a wine lover's paradise, and I would love to dive into the list. I really wish there was more room here, lower prices, and a bit less popularity-- I would love for this to be my around-the-corner spot for a glass of wine and a snack."

The ambiance, service and wine was good but I doubt I would be back as I don't live in Brooklyn. My recommendation is to skip the food and stick to wine if you do go."
Risa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/3/2020,5,I've tried to get into this spot a few times and the one time I was lucky we just ordered a few glasses of wine (no food).  Service was great - really liked the waitress and we had a conversation of the plant on the window bar side. She was super friendly and knowledgeable about the wines on the menu.  Will be back for food+wine next time!
Liz S.,"New York, NY",1/30/2019,4,"Four Horsemen is a hipster small plates and wine bar in Williamsburg, differentiated from its peers largely by its appearance on Master of None and its ownership by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. However, its reputation has generally stood up to the hype, so I visited a few months ago with my boyfriend for a Friday date night.First off, this place is tiny. I had a shocking moment when we stood up to leave and I realized the other half of the room was actually a mirror. It seats probably 15 in the main room and less than 10 at the bar. For weekend prime time, you'll need to book about 4 weeks out-- less than a week is completely fine for weeknights or off times. They also take walk-ins at the bar, but there's not much room to wait and I wouldn't call it amazing odds. As it was, we were seated about 10 minutes after our reservation.The vibe is excellent. Decor is minimalist and well-considered; looks like the apartment you wish you had. Lighting is a bit dark for my taste but feels very cool. Music on point, naturally. Very loud-- don't expect heart-to-hearts here. Service is some of the best I've had in New York, a sort of chatty, conspiratorial effortlessness.The wine list is huge. Thankfully, unlike a lot of trendy wine bars (cough, Wildair), they offer a good amount by the glass so committing to a bottle isn't necessary to get to the cool stuff. And the staff, used to questions, is well-versed in the list. We had two different orange wines that were spot-on with our waiter's description.If you do go by the bottle, there's a wealth of options in the $50-80 range. The list overall leans French, with Italy, Spain, and the US well represented as well as some oddball countries. Natural and conventional seem to be mixed together. Mostly small producers. You'll spot some that are ubiquitous on the NYC natural scene (2Naturkinder) but many of the obvious (Scholium, Donkey and Goat) are omitted; I had a hard time recognizing many. Skin contact and sparkling are at the front, and seem to be pretty popular here. I also appreciated that they have ""new additions"" and ""end of the case"" sections.The food list is comparatively easier to navigate, though you may need more assistance from the excellent service on how much to order. We ended up doing two starters, one raw, and two plates for two people, and mildly overordered.We started with house bread and butter ($7), good and worth getting if you're going to be doing mostly raw options or small plates. Next up was la marotte ($12), a semi-firm sheep's milk cheese shaved into a frilly ruffle with jam and massive cracker. This was great, but would recommend capping your meal off with this instead.I totally forget what raw we ordered ($20ish), remember it being small and a little too clean-tasting for me. Black trumpet toast ($20) was nice but what ended up being most striking was the fried sage topping. Finally, we had lamb ribs ($30ish), which was a bit of a hassle; some good bites in here nestled among the fat and gristle, but a nice glaze.Overall, despite being not being overly impressed by the food, I enjoyed my time here. It's a sexy place and they're doing some exciting things here. There's a reason this was the backdrop for the succession of Aziz Ansari's first dates, though I'd recommend knowing your date a bit better than that given the cost and noise level. This is also clearly a wine lover's paradise, and I would love to dive into the list. I really wish there was more room here, lower prices, and a bit less popularity-- I would love for this to be my around-the-corner spot for a glass of wine and a snack."
Ryan F.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",8/7/2019,4,"Went to The Four Horsemen for dinner on Saturday night. A lively wine bar with good wine, solid food, and excellent music.Quality: Decided to share some wine and small plates for dinner. As we waited for a seat we ordered a nice red off the last call area of the menu. The wine list is long, but we felt confident in something that clearly caught the interest of others. Once we sat we focused in on the appetizers and raw dishes. We started with the flavorful Chicken Liver Mousse. Served with light crackers, it was a solid dish. Next came the Warm House Bread, which was tremendous. I am usually skeptical of bread that does not come complimentary, but it was so good we got a second order. Last was the Beef Tartare, which I was not crazy about. The texture was strange with the addition of seeds and I also did not like the sesame seed crackers it came with. However, it seemed like a hit as it sat in front of nearly everyone at the bar.Quantity: We stuck with starters and raw dishes, which are understandably smaller, but they also have full plates.Value: $12 for the Chicken Liver Mousse. $7 for the Warm House Bread. $16 for the Beef Tartare. Wines start at around $40.Ambiance: The Four Horsemen is located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg. The wine bar is a small and simple space. A few stools along the front window, a tiny square bar towards the center of the space, and then a collection of tables in the back. Throughout the space are additional pockets where guests waiting for a table can lean and put down their drinks. The music is great, which should not be too surprising considering James Murphy's involvement with the bar, but it will be played loud. This is not a wine bar for quiet conversation.Crowd: It is not a large space and it fills up quick. When we arrived we were told a twenty minute wait, which was pretty accurate. Be warned, as it is a wine bar, people tend to linger and the wait may be underestimated.Service: Appreciated that the staff took care of those waiting for a seat. We were offered drinks and food while still standing.Parking: Limited street parking throughout the area."
Jenny W.,"New York, NY",12/20/2019,5,"I understand the hype. Loved my dinner at this intimate, cozy wine bar located in an otherwise nondescript part of WillIamsburg. The bar was packed even at 5:30pm - which makes sense because reservations are so hard to come by. But if you just manage to plan 3-4 weeks in advance, you can snag a reservation at a prime time here and it's very much worth it. Perfect place to catch up with a friend or go with a date. The food was all excellent. The highlight to my surprise was actually the butter bean purée - think hummus like consistency but with a brightness and lightness from lemon juice and  mint / herbs that's distinctly not hummus like. Also got their famed bread (good but I wouldn't make it a point to order it), spicy Spanish mackerel (comes with uni and tastes like a hand roll), lamb pappardelle (thin strips of pappardelle with a delicious and savory lamb make this dish lighter than I would have expected). Ended with the chocolate pine nut tart (with espresso cream) which was very rich and chocolate-y (not a must get, but enjoyable if you want to end on a sweet note)."
Tony R.,"Manhattan, NY",12/23/2019,4,"For brunch the food and price here are great.  $35 for three courses set menu.  Service is good.  The beef bourguignon, salad, and dessert were all very good.  Dinner is not a set menu, and I would be eager to return."
Meadow L.,"Chicago, IL",3/26/2020,4,This place is great. Great wines at reasonable prices. The food is always top notch. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. What more could you want
Tran T.,"Long Island, NY",11/12/2019,3,"My husband was dying to come here for his birthday and so I obliged. I emailed them ahead of time to see if I could add something special for the occasion to which they offered a candle with whichever dessert we wanted and noted the reservation... perfect! The bread and butter was the best part of our meal while the other dishes were not memorable. Service was impeccable... but they forgot about my husband's birthday. Just before I was going to point it out, our waitress came back with the wine we had been drinking and apologized for not seeing the note sooner and offered us 2 glasses on the house, so they made it right! The bill was a hefty $300 and the food was unfortunately nothing to write home about."
Steph C.,"New York, NY",3/12/2020,3,Chicken liver mousse was stellar. Excellent wine list. A few overpriced dishes. The rhubarb galette was good but not worth $15.
Liz W.,"New York, NY",3/2/2020,1,"The rudest service I've ever encountered in NYC, and I've lived here for almost 20 years. I went on a Saturday night, and it was packed - which was expected, considering the hype. The host informed me that she wasn't taking names, it would be an hour wait, and there was no space to wait, so she wasn't sure how I was going to handle that. In not so many words, she told me to leave. It's such a turn off when there's a host on a power trip for no reason - and ESPECIALLY in Williamsburg, there are many more places that can take my money. I will never set foot in this place again."
Edward J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/21/2019,5,"Delightful, simply executed and well constructed plates, think a bowl of perfect cherry tomatoes and a dollop of garlicky aioli, a plate of charred scallions with earthy squash and peppery pecorino, or a almond semifreddo with olive oil and flaky salt. The weekend lunch is kind of perfect. I love that they give you the time and the space to lounge away, get a couple of glasses of wine and enjoy the company. And the wine is great -- a lot of depth here. The service is warm and inviting. One of the best spots in the city and the perfect way to spend a weekend afternoon."
Ellyn M.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/14/2019,5,"I tell no lies when I say this is my actual favorite restaurant. One time I had a pea dish here so good that it made me cry. Twice.The menu is rotating, but you can't go wrong with the staples: bread and butter, raw scallops, steak tartare.The servers here are the most knowledgeable and friendly wine-os I've ever encountered.Their weekend lunch coursed meal is the crown on the very obviously king that is this restaurant. I've been here about 15 times and each time the flavors remain delicious and consistent. Keep doing what you're doing, Four Horsemen, and I will forever be your longing admirer."
Stefan H.,"New York, NY",3/1/2020,5,"The Four Horsemen is as good a restaurant as it is a wine bar. Regarding the food, there are no wrong choices. The Mackerel, the tuna, and home-made sausage are just as good as the cabbage, the fava beans and the asparagus. There are no wrong answers and the waiter will help you pick out a wine that goes perfectly with the meal"
Michael D.,"New York, NY",7/4/2020,5,"We ate there today, our first venture out during COVID. What a lovely late afternoon lunch. The sun was warm, we had a very nice table for two. The limited menu (who doesn't?) had Antipasti which was very tasty, loved the addition of anchovy. I had a cheeseburger and fries (don't laugh!) and it was delicious. They serve natural wines which I adore and I had a nice full bodied rose. They give you safety instructions as you sit down and the staff were as diligent as one can be. We felt extraordinarily safe. After this positive experience, there is no way in hel..I am going ""Inside"" a NYC restaurant and try to stay safe. Outstanding service too. Give this place some love, won't you?"
Chris M.,"Culver City, CA",2/20/2020,5,"Hi guys,We had dinner tonight and it was super amazing! The food was soooo delicious and the service was excellent. From the beginning of our evening, Lisa was super cordial (and funny) and Blaise (sp?) provided excellent guidance through our meal, including the wine.  5 star cudos to the chef and everyone on board...until next time."
Brian L.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",3/13/2020,3,"Starting to lose faith with the Michelin guide. From disappointments with Estela, Claro and now Horsemen, I'm starting to question the integrity and honesty with the Michelin system. Mussels. 6 is these things. Fresh and meaty with a nice citrus salsa on top. Nothing special. Salt cod fritters. Good but it's a fritter so you there isn't anything unexpected other than how average it is. Tuna crudo. It's served like a hanger steak. You need to cut it. Oil and cream on the bottom. Big slab of tuna on top. Wasn't a big fan of it. Asparagus dish was overpowered from the grated cheese and almonds. I barely tasted any asparagus since it was shaved thin. Pappardelle with lamb beck ragu was good but nothing a nice Italian place couldn't do. Nothing that I nor you wouldn't have had. Shrimp was very good. Probably my favorite thing of the night. Peppery with a good kick. A bunch of okay dishes that were fine but nothing really stood out. Dishes here change frequently so maybe I just went on a bad night."
Benjamin F.,"San Francisco, CA",12/20/2019,5,"A friend of mine recommended that we go to his favorite place in the neighborhood (The Four Horseman) and boy am I glad he loves this place because I now love it too. Conceptually perfect, this restaurants menu changes every week with a lovely little prefix three course lunch/dinner. The price for the food (see photos) was just over thirty bucks for our lunch and well worth it. I thought the pasta was so GD delicious that I'm still dreaming about it. The other dishes were well executed and perfect accompaniments but that pasta...hot damn. The coolest part of the place is easily the wine list. It's geeky, fun and there's something for everyone. The servers are super gracious in helping you select a great wine and will offer tastes of the btg list if you ask nicely. Bravo Four Horseman. See you again ASAP."
Daniel S.,"New York, NY",11/27/2019,4,"There's some people that you love to hate.  Aziz Ansari is one of those celebrities. He's borderline annoying, but still relatable and funny sometimes. You may have noticed this restaurant on his show Master of None, where he brings all his first dates. A newly minted Michelin star for 2019, The Four Horsemen is a wine bar / restaurant in Brooklyn. I usually never make my way to the BK, but my goal to collect all the stars in New York led me here and also hopes to see my boy Aziz. Resy's are extremely hard to get with their new star, so I recommend planning early if you want to eat here. The dining room is small.The menu is small and is split in three sections. Starters, raw/cured, and main pates.Starts--bread and cultured butter -- a must!! one of the best breads I've had--chicken liver mousse - loved this dish, the mousse was perfectly creamy and paired well with the chips they giveRaw / Cured-- spicy bonito - maine uni, rice and nori - was not bad, the uni gave this dish a creamy texture and it had a good spice. It was fun to make my little sushi pieces with the nori--montauk sea scallops - leche de tigre, daikon, fish sauce - extremely fresh scallops, and the sauce was really refreshingPlates--Potato gnocchi - puur ground fonduta, smoked mushroom, chives - prob my least fav of the night - flavors didn't really stand out to me - would pass--Grilled sasso chicken leg - koginut squash, brown butter - when the dish came out, it scared me with the chicken feet still on it lol. The miso glaze was amazing and the squash and brown butter was heavenly Dessert--Chocolate tart - not too sweet, loved the ice cream with it--Ginger Ice cream - not too gingery, good palate cleanser for the nightThe Four Hoursemen is a great spot for date night. It's a dim place and full of romance. Their wine list is huge as well. The service was excellent. It's pretty affordable too for the quality of food."
Sasha P.,"New York, NY",1/11/2020,5,"Had a great afternoon here to try some new wine, a cheese board and the prosciutto! We went in the early afternoon on a Saturday and we were able to sit right down-- we made a reservation but would've been fine without one. The service was laid back yet helpful and attentive when we had questions. The cheese with the jam was an incredible pairing along with the prosciutto- We'll definitely be back to try the dinner menu."
Reshard R.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/12/2019,5,"It finally happened. I was emotionally touched by food, service, and ambiance all at once. This gem on Grand has a Michelin star. At first you think its hype this star business until you realize that Chef is not playing with you. You are being dealt with in a manner appropriate for a foodie. ...and you like it."
Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",4/19/2019,3,"5 star service, 2 star food. I had seen and heard raving reviews of this place so I was excited to come here for dinner with a few of my girlfriends yesterday night. From the beginning, the service was impeccable. They were extremely understanding about moving our reservation a half hour later and were always there when when had a question or needed something. They even went to the cellar to get a bottle of white wine that my party wanted to drink unchilled.Unfortunately the food was not on par with the service. We started with the raw scallops which I found to be extremely fishy and flavorless. Next was the shrimp, which was flavorless and fishy as well. I found both to be unpleasant to eat. The crispy potatoes were the best dish of the night but.. how hard is it to mess up potatoes? We got a pasta dish as well which was fine but nothing to write home about. My biggest disappointment however was the frangipane tart. It was tough and the outer crust was burnt. You know that a dessert isn't good when 4 girls end up leaving some behind after a light dinner. The ambiance, service and wine was good but I doubt I would be back as I don't live in Brooklyn. My recommendation is to skip the food and stick to wine if you do go."

Daniel S.,"New York, NY",11/27/2019,4,"There's some people that you love to hate.  Aziz Ansari is one of those celebrities. He's borderline annoying, but still relatable and funny sometimes. You may have noticed this restaurant on his show Master of None, where he brings all his first dates. A newly minted Michelin star for 2019, The Four Horsemen is a wine bar / restaurant in Brooklyn. I usually never make my way to the BK, but my goal to collect all the stars in New York led me here and also hopes to see my boy Aziz. Resy's are extremely hard to get with their new star, so I recommend planning early if you want to eat here. The dining room is small.The menu is small and is split in three sections. Starters, raw/cured, and main pates.Starts--bread and cultured butter -- a must!! one of the best breads I've had--chicken liver mousse - loved this dish, the mousse was perfectly creamy and paired well with the chips they giveRaw / Cured-- spicy bonito - maine uni, rice and nori - was not bad, the uni gave this dish a creamy texture and it had a good spice. It was fun to make my little sushi pieces with the nori--montauk sea scallops - leche de tigre, daikon, fish sauce - extremely fresh scallops, and the sauce was really refreshingPlates--Potato gnocchi - puur ground fonduta, smoked mushroom, chives - prob my least fav of the night - flavors didn't really stand out to me - would pass--Grilled sasso chicken leg - koginut squash, brown butter - when the dish came out, it scared me with the chicken feet still on it lol. The miso glaze was amazing and the squash and brown butter was heavenly Dessert--Chocolate tart - not too sweet, loved the ice cream with it--Ginger Ice cream - not too gingery, good palate cleanser for the nightThe Four Hoursemen is a great spot for date night. It's a dim place and full of romance. Their wine list is huge as well. The service was excellent. It's pretty affordable too for the quality of food."
Sasha P.,"New York, NY",1/11/2020,5,"Had a great afternoon here to try some new wine, a cheese board and the prosciutto! We went in the early afternoon on a Saturday and we were able to sit right down-- we made a reservation but would've been fine without one. The service was laid back yet helpful and attentive when we had questions. The cheese with the jam was an incredible pairing along with the prosciutto- We'll definitely be back to try the dinner menu."
Reshard R.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/12/2019,5,"It finally happened. I was emotionally touched by food, service, and ambiance all at once. This gem on Grand has a Michelin star. At first you think its hype this star business until you realize that Chef is not playing with you. You are being dealt with in a manner appropriate for a foodie. ...and you like it."
Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",4/19/2019,3,"5 star service, 2 star food. I had seen and heard raving reviews of this place so I was excited to come here for dinner with a few of my girlfriends yesterday night. From the beginning, the service was impeccable. They were extremely understanding about moving our reservation a half hour later and were always there when when had a question or needed something. They even went to the cellar to get a bottle of white wine that my party wanted to drink unchilled.Unfortunately the food was not on par with the service. We started with the raw scallops which I found to be extremely fishy and flavorless. Next was the shrimp, which was flavorless and fishy as well. I found both to be unpleasant to eat. The crispy potatoes were the best dish of the night but.. how hard is it to mess up potatoes? We got a pasta dish as well which was fine but nothing to write home about. My biggest disappointment however was the frangipane tart. It was tough and the outer crust was burnt. You know that a dessert isn't good when 4 girls end up leaving some behind after a light dinner. The ambiance, service and wine was good but I doubt I would be back as I don't live in Brooklyn. My recommendation is to skip the food and stick to wine if you do go."
Risa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/3/2020,5,I've tried to get into this spot a few times and the one time I was lucky we just ordered a few glasses of wine (no food).  Service was great - really liked the waitress and we had a conversation of the plant on the window bar side. She was super friendly and knowledgeable about the wines on the menu.  Will be back for food+wine next time!
Liz S.,"New York, NY",1/30/2019,4,"Four Horsemen is a hipster small plates and wine bar in Williamsburg, differentiated from its peers largely by its appearance on Master of None and its ownership by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. However, its reputation has generally stood up to the hype, so I visited a few months ago with my boyfriend for a Friday date night.First off, this place is tiny. I had a shocking moment when we stood up to leave and I realized the other half of the room was actually a mirror. It seats probably 15 in the main room and less than 10 at the bar. For weekend prime time, you'll need to book about 4 weeks out-- less than a week is completely fine for weeknights or off times. They also take walk-ins at the bar, but there's not much room to wait and I wouldn't call it amazing odds. As it was, we were seated about 10 minutes after our reservation.The vibe is excellent. Decor is minimalist and well-considered; looks like the apartment you wish you had. Lighting is a bit dark for my taste but feels very cool. Music on point, naturally. Very loud-- don't expect heart-to-hearts here. Service is some of the best I've had in New York, a sort of chatty, conspiratorial effortlessness.The wine list is huge. Thankfully, unlike a lot of trendy wine bars (cough, Wildair), they offer a good amount by the glass so committing to a bottle isn't necessary to get to the cool stuff. And the staff, used to questions, is well-versed in the list. We had two different orange wines that were spot-on with our waiter's description.If you do go by the bottle, there's a wealth of options in the $50-80 range. The list overall leans French, with Italy, Spain, and the US well represented as well as some oddball countries. Natural and conventional seem to be mixed together. Mostly small producers. You'll spot some that are ubiquitous on the NYC natural scene (2Naturkinder) but many of the obvious (Scholium, Donkey and Goat) are omitted; I had a hard time recognizing many. Skin contact and sparkling are at the front, and seem to be pretty popular here. I also appreciated that they have ""new additions"" and ""end of the case"" sections.The food list is comparatively easier to navigate, though you may need more assistance from the excellent service on how much to order. We ended up doing two starters, one raw, and two plates for two people, and mildly overordered.We started with house bread and butter ($7), good and worth getting if you're going to be doing mostly raw options or small plates. Next up was la marotte ($12), a semi-firm sheep's milk cheese shaved into a frilly ruffle with jam and massive cracker. This was great, but would recommend capping your meal off with this instead.I totally forget what raw we ordered ($20ish), remember it being small and a little too clean-tasting for me. Black trumpet toast ($20) was nice but what ended up being most striking was the fried sage topping. Finally, we had lamb ribs ($30ish), which was a bit of a hassle; some good bites in here nestled among the fat and gristle, but a nice glaze.Overall, despite being not being overly impressed by the food, I enjoyed my time here. It's a sexy place and they're doing some exciting things here. There's a reason this was the backdrop for the succession of Aziz Ansari's first dates, though I'd recommend knowing your date a bit better than that given the cost and noise level. This is also clearly a wine lover's paradise, and I would love to dive into the list. I really wish there was more room here, lower prices, and a bit less popularity-- I would love for this to be my around-the-corner spot for a glass of wine and a snack."
Ryan F.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",8/7/2019,4,"Went to The Four Horsemen for dinner on Saturday night. A lively wine bar with good wine, solid food, and excellent music.Quality: Decided to share some wine and small plates for dinner. As we waited for a seat we ordered a nice red off the last call area of the menu. The wine list is long, but we felt confident in something that clearly caught the interest of others. Once we sat we focused in on the appetizers and raw dishes. We started with the flavorful Chicken Liver Mousse. Served with light crackers, it was a solid dish. Next came the Warm House Bread, which was tremendous. I am usually skeptical of bread that does not come complimentary, but it was so good we got a second order. Last was the Beef Tartare, which I was not crazy about. The texture was strange with the addition of seeds and I also did not like the sesame seed crackers it came with. However, it seemed like a hit as it sat in front of nearly everyone at the bar.Quantity: We stuck with starters and raw dishes, which are understandably smaller, but they also have full plates.Value: $12 for the Chicken Liver Mousse. $7 for the Warm House Bread. $16 for the Beef Tartare. Wines start at around $40.Ambiance: The Four Horsemen is located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg. The wine bar is a small and simple space. A few stools along the front window, a tiny square bar towards the center of the space, and then a collection of tables in the back. Throughout the space are additional pockets where guests waiting for a table can lean and put down their drinks. The music is great, which should not be too surprising considering James Murphy's involvement with the bar, but it will be played loud. This is not a wine bar for quiet conversation.Crowd: It is not a large space and it fills up quick. When we arrived we were told a twenty minute wait, which was pretty accurate. Be warned, as it is a wine bar, people tend to linger and the wait may be underestimated.Service: Appreciated that the staff took care of those waiting for a seat. We were offered drinks and food while still standing.Parking: Limited street parking throughout the area."
Jenny W.,"New York, NY",12/20/2019,5,"I understand the hype. Loved my dinner at this intimate, cozy wine bar located in an otherwise nondescript part of WillIamsburg. The bar was packed even at 5:30pm - which makes sense because reservations are so hard to come by. But if you just manage to plan 3-4 weeks in advance, you can snag a reservation at a prime time here and it's very much worth it. Perfect place to catch up with a friend or go with a date. The food was all excellent. The highlight to my surprise was actually the butter bean purée - think hummus like consistency but with a brightness and lightness from lemon juice and  mint / herbs that's distinctly not hummus like. Also got their famed bread (good but I wouldn't make it a point to order it), spicy Spanish mackerel (comes with uni and tastes like a hand roll), lamb pappardelle (thin strips of pappardelle with a delicious and savory lamb make this dish lighter than I would have expected). Ended with the chocolate pine nut tart (with espresso cream) which was very rich and chocolate-y (not a must get, but enjoyable if you want to end on a sweet note)."
Tony R.,"Manhattan, NY",12/23/2019,4,"For brunch the food and price here are great.  $35 for three courses set menu.  Service is good.  The beef bourguignon, salad, and dessert were all very good.  Dinner is not a set menu, and I would be eager to return."
Meadow L.,"Chicago, IL",3/26/2020,4,This place is great. Great wines at reasonable prices. The food is always top notch. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. What more could you want
Tran T.,"Long Island, NY",11/12/2019,3,"My husband was dying to come here for his birthday and so I obliged. I emailed them ahead of time to see if I could add something special for the occasion to which they offered a candle with whichever dessert we wanted and noted the reservation... perfect! The bread and butter was the best part of our meal while the other dishes were not memorable. Service was impeccable... but they forgot about my husband's birthday. Just before I was going to point it out, our waitress came back with the wine we had been drinking and apologized for not seeing the note sooner and offered us 2 glasses on the house, so they made it right! The bill was a hefty $300 and the food was unfortunately nothing to write home about."
Steph C.,"New York, NY",3/12/2020,3,Chicken liver mousse was stellar. Excellent wine list. A few overpriced dishes. The rhubarb galette was good but not worth $15.
Liz W.,"New York, NY",3/2/2020,1,"The rudest service I've ever encountered in NYC, and I've lived here for almost 20 years. I went on a Saturday night, and it was packed - which was expected, considering the hype. The host informed me that she wasn't taking names, it would be an hour wait, and there was no space to wait, so she wasn't sure how I was going to handle that. In not so many words, she told me to leave. It's such a turn off when there's a host on a power trip for no reason - and ESPECIALLY in Williamsburg, there are many more places that can take my money. I will never set foot in this place again."
Edward J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/21/2019,5,"Delightful, simply executed and well constructed plates, think a bowl of perfect cherry tomatoes and a dollop of garlicky aioli, a plate of charred scallions with earthy squash and peppery pecorino, or a almond semifreddo with olive oil and flaky salt. The weekend lunch is kind of perfect. I love that they give you the time and the space to lounge away, get a couple of glasses of wine and enjoy the company. And the wine is great -- a lot of depth here. The service is warm and inviting. One of the best spots in the city and the perfect way to spend a weekend afternoon."
Ellyn M.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/14/2019,5,"I tell no lies when I say this is my actual favorite restaurant. One time I had a pea dish here so good that it made me cry. Twice.The menu is rotating, but you can't go wrong with the staples: bread and butter, raw scallops, steak tartare.The servers here are the most knowledgeable and friendly wine-os I've ever encountered.Their weekend lunch coursed meal is the crown on the very obviously king that is this restaurant. I've been here about 15 times and each time the flavors remain delicious and consistent. Keep doing what you're doing, Four Horsemen, and I will forever be your longing admirer."
Stefan H.,"New York, NY",3/1/2020,5,"The Four Horsemen is as good a restaurant as it is a wine bar. Regarding the food, there are no wrong choices. The Mackerel, the tuna, and home-made sausage are just as good as the cabbage, the fava beans and the asparagus. There are no wrong answers and the waiter will help you pick out a wine that goes perfectly with the meal"
Michael D.,"New York, NY",7/4/2020,5,"We ate there today, our first venture out during COVID. What a lovely late afternoon lunch. The sun was warm, we had a very nice table for two. The limited menu (who doesn't?) had Antipasti which was very tasty, loved the addition of anchovy. I had a cheeseburger and fries (don't laugh!) and it was delicious. They serve natural wines which I adore and I had a nice full bodied rose. They give you safety instructions as you sit down and the staff were as diligent as one can be. We felt extraordinarily safe. After this positive experience, there is no way in hel..I am going ""Inside"" a NYC restaurant and try to stay safe. Outstanding service too. Give this place some love, won't you?"
Chris M.,"Culver City, CA",2/20/2020,5,"Hi guys,We had dinner tonight and it was super amazing! The food was soooo delicious and the service was excellent. From the beginning of our evening, Lisa was super cordial (and funny) and Blaise (sp?) provided excellent guidance through our meal, including the wine.  5 star cudos to the chef and everyone on board...until next time."
Brian L.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",3/13/2020,3,"Starting to lose faith with the Michelin guide. From disappointments with Estela, Claro and now Horsemen, I'm starting to question the integrity and honesty with the Michelin system. Mussels. 6 is these things. Fresh and meaty with a nice citrus salsa on top. Nothing special. Salt cod fritters. Good but it's a fritter so you there isn't anything unexpected other than how average it is. Tuna crudo. It's served like a hanger steak. You need to cut it. Oil and cream on the bottom. Big slab of tuna on top. Wasn't a big fan of it. Asparagus dish was overpowered from the grated cheese and almonds. I barely tasted any asparagus since it was shaved thin. Pappardelle with lamb beck ragu was good but nothing a nice Italian place couldn't do. Nothing that I nor you wouldn't have had. Shrimp was very good. Probably my favorite thing of the night. Peppery with a good kick. A bunch of okay dishes that were fine but nothing really stood out. Dishes here change frequently so maybe I just went on a bad night."
Benjamin F.,"San Francisco, CA",12/20/2019,5,"A friend of mine recommended that we go to his favorite place in the neighborhood (The Four Horseman) and boy am I glad he loves this place because I now love it too. Conceptually perfect, this restaurants menu changes every week with a lovely little prefix three course lunch/dinner. The price for the food (see photos) was just over thirty bucks for our lunch and well worth it. I thought the pasta was so GD delicious that I'm still dreaming about it. The other dishes were well executed and perfect accompaniments but that pasta...hot damn. The coolest part of the place is easily the wine list. It's geeky, fun and there's something for everyone. The servers are super gracious in helping you select a great wine and will offer tastes of the btg list if you ask nicely. Bravo Four Horseman. See you again ASAP."

Twice.The menu is rotating, but you can't go wrong with the staples: bread and butter, raw scallops, steak tartare.The servers here are the most knowledgeable and friendly wine-os I've ever encountered.Their weekend lunch coursed meal is the crown on the very obviously king that is this restaurant. I've been here about 15 times and each time the flavors remain delicious and consistent. Keep doing what you're doing, Four Horsemen, and I will forever be your longing admirer."
Stefan H.,"New York, NY",3/1/2020,5,"The Four Horsemen is as good a restaurant as it is a wine bar. Regarding the food, there are no wrong choices. The Mackerel, the tuna, and home-made sausage are just as good as the cabbage, the fava beans and the asparagus. There are no wrong answers and the waiter will help you pick out a wine that goes perfectly with the meal"
Michael D.,"New York, NY",7/4/2020,5,"We ate there today, our first venture out during COVID. What a lovely late afternoon lunch. The sun was warm, we had a very nice table for two. The limited menu (who doesn't?) had Antipasti which was very tasty, loved the addition of anchovy. I had a cheeseburger and fries (don't laugh!) and it was delicious. They serve natural wines which I adore and I had a nice full bodied rose. They give you safety instructions as you sit down and the staff were as diligent as one can be. We felt extraordinarily safe. After this positive experience, there is no way in hel..I am going ""Inside"" a NYC restaurant and try to stay safe. Outstanding service too. Give this place some love, won't you?"
Chris M.,"Culver City, CA",2/20/2020,5,"Hi guys,We had dinner tonight and it was super amazing! The food was soooo delicious and the service was excellent. From the beginning of our evening, Lisa was super cordial (and funny) and Blaise (sp?) provided excellent guidance through our meal, including the wine.  5 star cudos to the chef and everyone on board...until next time."
Brian L.,"LONG ISLAND CITY, NY",3/13/2020,3,"Starting to lose faith with the Michelin guide. From disappointments with Estela, Claro and now Horsemen, I'm starting to question the integrity and honesty with the Michelin system. Mussels. 6 is these things. Fresh and meaty with a nice citrus salsa on top. Nothing special. Salt cod fritters. Good but it's a fritter so you there isn't anything unexpected other than how average it is. Tuna crudo. It's served like a hanger steak. You need to cut it. Oil and cream on the bottom. Big slab of tuna on top. Wasn't a big fan of it. Asparagus dish was overpowered from the grated cheese and almonds. I barely tasted any asparagus since it was shaved thin. Pappardelle with lamb beck ragu was good but nothing a nice Italian place couldn't do. Nothing that I nor you wouldn't have had. Shrimp was very good. Probably my favorite thing of the night. Peppery with a good kick. A bunch of okay dishes that were fine but nothing really stood out. Dishes here change frequently so maybe I just went on a bad night."
Benjamin F.,"San Francisco, CA",12/20/2019,5,"A friend of mine recommended that we go to his favorite place in the neighborhood (The Four Horseman) and boy am I glad he loves this place because I now love it too. Conceptually perfect, this restaurants menu changes every week with a lovely little prefix three course lunch/dinner. The price for the food (see photos) was just over thirty bucks for our lunch and well worth it. I thought the pasta was so GD delicious that I'm still dreaming about it. The other dishes were well executed and perfect accompaniments but that pasta...hot damn. The coolest part of the place is easily the wine list. It's geeky, fun and there's something for everyone. The servers are super gracious in helping you select a great wine and will offer tastes of the btg list if you ask nicely. Bravo Four Horseman. See you again ASAP."
Daniel S.,"New York, NY",11/27/2019,4,"There's some people that you love to hate.  Aziz Ansari is one of those celebrities. He's borderline annoying, but still relatable and funny sometimes. You may have noticed this restaurant on his show Master of None, where he brings all his first dates. A newly minted Michelin star for 2019, The Four Horsemen is a wine bar / restaurant in Brooklyn. I usually never make my way to the BK, but my goal to collect all the stars in New York led me here and also hopes to see my boy Aziz. Resy's are extremely hard to get with their new star, so I recommend planning early if you want to eat here. The dining room is small.The menu is small and is split in three sections. Starters, raw/cured, and main pates.Starts--bread and cultured butter -- a must!! one of the best breads I've had--chicken liver mousse - loved this dish, the mousse was perfectly creamy and paired well with the chips they giveRaw / Cured-- spicy bonito - maine uni, rice and nori - was not bad, the uni gave this dish a creamy texture and it had a good spice. It was fun to make my little sushi pieces with the nori--montauk sea scallops - leche de tigre, daikon, fish sauce - extremely fresh scallops, and the sauce was really refreshingPlates--Potato gnocchi - puur ground fonduta, smoked mushroom, chives - prob my least fav of the night - flavors didn't really stand out to me - would pass--Grilled sasso chicken leg - koginut squash, brown butter - when the dish came out, it scared me with the chicken feet still on it lol. The miso glaze was amazing and the squash and brown butter was heavenly Dessert--Chocolate tart - not too sweet, loved the ice cream with it--Ginger Ice cream - not too gingery, good palate cleanser for the nightThe Four Hoursemen is a great spot for date night. It's a dim place and full of romance. Their wine list is huge as well. The service was excellent. It's pretty affordable too for the quality of food."
Sasha P.,"New York, NY",1/11/2020,5,"Had a great afternoon here to try some new wine, a cheese board and the prosciutto! We went in the early afternoon on a Saturday and we were able to sit right down-- we made a reservation but would've been fine without one. The service was laid back yet helpful and attentive when we had questions. The cheese with the jam was an incredible pairing along with the prosciutto- We'll definitely be back to try the dinner menu."
Reshard R.,"Brooklyn, NY",12/12/2019,5,"It finally happened. I was emotionally touched by food, service, and ambiance all at once. This gem on Grand has a Michelin star. At first you think its hype this star business until you realize that Chef is not playing with you. You are being dealt with in a manner appropriate for a foodie. ...and you like it."
Alexandra C.,"New York, NY",4/19/2019,3,"5 star service, 2 star food. I had seen and heard raving reviews of this place so I was excited to come here for dinner with a few of my girlfriends yesterday night. From the beginning, the service was impeccable. They were extremely understanding about moving our reservation a half hour later and were always there when when had a question or needed something. They even went to the cellar to get a bottle of white wine that my party wanted to drink unchilled.Unfortunately the food was not on par with the service. We started with the raw scallops which I found to be extremely fishy and flavorless. Next was the shrimp, which was flavorless and fishy as well. I found both to be unpleasant to eat. The crispy potatoes were the best dish of the night but.. how hard is it to mess up potatoes? We got a pasta dish as well which was fine but nothing to write home about. My biggest disappointment however was the frangipane tart. It was tough and the outer crust was burnt. You know that a dessert isn't good when 4 girls end up leaving some behind after a light dinner. The ambiance, service and wine was good but I doubt I would be back as I don't live in Brooklyn. My recommendation is to skip the food and stick to wine if you do go."
Risa H.,"Brooklyn, NY",3/3/2020,5,I've tried to get into this spot a few times and the one time I was lucky we just ordered a few glasses of wine (no food).  Service was great - really liked the waitress and we had a conversation of the plant on the window bar side. She was super friendly and knowledgeable about the wines on the menu.  Will be back for food+wine next time!
Liz S.,"New York, NY",1/30/2019,4,"Four Horsemen is a hipster small plates and wine bar in Williamsburg, differentiated from its peers largely by its appearance on Master of None and its ownership by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. However, its reputation has generally stood up to the hype, so I visited a few months ago with my boyfriend for a Friday date night.First off, this place is tiny. I had a shocking moment when we stood up to leave and I realized the other half of the room was actually a mirror. It seats probably 15 in the main room and less than 10 at the bar. For weekend prime time, you'll need to book about 4 weeks out-- less than a week is completely fine for weeknights or off times. They also take walk-ins at the bar, but there's not much room to wait and I wouldn't call it amazing odds. As it was, we were seated about 10 minutes after our reservation.The vibe is excellent. Decor is minimalist and well-considered; looks like the apartment you wish you had. Lighting is a bit dark for my taste but feels very cool. Music on point, naturally. Very loud-- don't expect heart-to-hearts here. Service is some of the best I've had in New York, a sort of chatty, conspiratorial effortlessness.The wine list is huge. Thankfully, unlike a lot of trendy wine bars (cough, Wildair), they offer a good amount by the glass so committing to a bottle isn't necessary to get to the cool stuff. And the staff, used to questions, is well-versed in the list. We had two different orange wines that were spot-on with our waiter's description.If you do go by the bottle, there's a wealth of options in the $50-80 range. The list overall leans French, with Italy, Spain, and the US well represented as well as some oddball countries. Natural and conventional seem to be mixed together. Mostly small producers. You'll spot some that are ubiquitous on the NYC natural scene (2Naturkinder) but many of the obvious (Scholium, Donkey and Goat) are omitted; I had a hard time recognizing many. Skin contact and sparkling are at the front, and seem to be pretty popular here. I also appreciated that they have ""new additions"" and ""end of the case"" sections.The food list is comparatively easier to navigate, though you may need more assistance from the excellent service on how much to order. We ended up doing two starters, one raw, and two plates for two people, and mildly overordered.We started with house bread and butter ($7), good and worth getting if you're going to be doing mostly raw options or small plates. Next up was la marotte ($12), a semi-firm sheep's milk cheese shaved into a frilly ruffle with jam and massive cracker. This was great, but would recommend capping your meal off with this instead.I totally forget what raw we ordered ($20ish), remember it being small and a little too clean-tasting for me. Black trumpet toast ($20) was nice but what ended up being most striking was the fried sage topping. Finally, we had lamb ribs ($30ish), which was a bit of a hassle; some good bites in here nestled among the fat and gristle, but a nice glaze.Overall, despite being not being overly impressed by the food, I enjoyed my time here. It's a sexy place and they're doing some exciting things here. There's a reason this was the backdrop for the succession of Aziz Ansari's first dates, though I'd recommend knowing your date a bit better than that given the cost and noise level. This is also clearly a wine lover's paradise, and I would love to dive into the list. I really wish there was more room here, lower prices, and a bit less popularity-- I would love for this to be my around-the-corner spot for a glass of wine and a snack."
Ryan F.,"Forest Hills, Queens, NY",8/7/2019,4,"Went to The Four Horsemen for dinner on Saturday night. A lively wine bar with good wine, solid food, and excellent music.Quality: Decided to share some wine and small plates for dinner. As we waited for a seat we ordered a nice red off the last call area of the menu. The wine list is long, but we felt confident in something that clearly caught the interest of others. Once we sat we focused in on the appetizers and raw dishes. We started with the flavorful Chicken Liver Mousse. Served with light crackers, it was a solid dish. Next came the Warm House Bread, which was tremendous. I am usually skeptical of bread that does not come complimentary, but it was so good we got a second order. Last was the Beef Tartare, which I was not crazy about. The texture was strange with the addition of seeds and I also did not like the sesame seed crackers it came with. However, it seemed like a hit as it sat in front of nearly everyone at the bar.Quantity: We stuck with starters and raw dishes, which are understandably smaller, but they also have full plates.Value: $12 for the Chicken Liver Mousse. $7 for the Warm House Bread. $16 for the Beef Tartare. Wines start at around $40.Ambiance: The Four Horsemen is located in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Williamsburg. The wine bar is a small and simple space. A few stools along the front window, a tiny square bar towards the center of the space, and then a collection of tables in the back. Throughout the space are additional pockets where guests waiting for a table can lean and put down their drinks. The music is great, which should not be too surprising considering James Murphy's involvement with the bar, but it will be played loud. This is not a wine bar for quiet conversation.Crowd: It is not a large space and it fills up quick. When we arrived we were told a twenty minute wait, which was pretty accurate. Be warned, as it is a wine bar, people tend to linger and the wait may be underestimated.Service: Appreciated that the staff took care of those waiting for a seat. We were offered drinks and food while still standing.Parking: Limited street parking throughout the area."
Jenny W.,"New York, NY",12/20/2019,5,"I understand the hype. Loved my dinner at this intimate, cozy wine bar located in an otherwise nondescript part of WillIamsburg. The bar was packed even at 5:30pm - which makes sense because reservations are so hard to come by. But if you just manage to plan 3-4 weeks in advance, you can snag a reservation at a prime time here and it's very much worth it. Perfect place to catch up with a friend or go with a date. The food was all excellent. The highlight to my surprise was actually the butter bean purée - think hummus like consistency but with a brightness and lightness from lemon juice and  mint / herbs that's distinctly not hummus like. Also got their famed bread (good but I wouldn't make it a point to order it), spicy Spanish mackerel (comes with uni and tastes like a hand roll), lamb pappardelle (thin strips of pappardelle with a delicious and savory lamb make this dish lighter than I would have expected). Ended with the chocolate pine nut tart (with espresso cream) which was very rich and chocolate-y (not a must get, but enjoyable if you want to end on a sweet note)."
Tony R.,"Manhattan, NY",12/23/2019,4,"For brunch the food and price here are great.  $35 for three courses set menu.  Service is good.  The beef bourguignon, salad, and dessert were all very good.  Dinner is not a set menu, and I would be eager to return."
Meadow L.,"Chicago, IL",3/26/2020,4,This place is great. Great wines at reasonable prices. The food is always top notch. The servers are knowledgeable and friendly. What more could you want
Tran T.,"Long Island, NY",11/12/2019,3,"My husband was dying to come here for his birthday and so I obliged. I emailed them ahead of time to see if I could add something special for the occasion to which they offered a candle with whichever dessert we wanted and noted the reservation... perfect! The bread and butter was the best part of our meal while the other dishes were not memorable. Service was impeccable... but they forgot about my husband's birthday. Just before I was going to point it out, our waitress came back with the wine we had been drinking and apologized for not seeing the note sooner and offered us 2 glasses on the house, so they made it right! The bill was a hefty $300 and the food was unfortunately nothing to write home about."
Steph C.,"New York, NY",3/12/2020,3,Chicken liver mousse was stellar. Excellent wine list. A few overpriced dishes. The rhubarb galette was good but not worth $15.
Liz W.,"New York, NY",3/2/2020,1,"The rudest service I've ever encountered in NYC, and I've lived here for almost 20 years. I went on a Saturday night, and it was packed - which was expected, considering the hype. The host informed me that she wasn't taking names, it would be an hour wait, and there was no space to wait, so she wasn't sure how I was going to handle that. In not so many words, she told me to leave. It's such a turn off when there's a host on a power trip for no reason - and ESPECIALLY in Williamsburg, there are many more places that can take my money. I will never set foot in this place again."
Edward J.,"Brooklyn, NY",9/21/2019,5,"Delightful, simply executed and well constructed plates, think a bowl of perfect cherry tomatoes and a dollop of garlicky aioli, a plate of charred scallions with earthy squash and peppery pecorino, or a almond semifreddo with olive oil and flaky salt. The weekend lunch is kind of perfect. I love that they give you the time and the space to lounge away, get a couple of glasses of wine and enjoy the company. And the wine is great -- a lot of depth here. The service is warm and inviting. One of the best spots in the city and the perfect way to spend a weekend afternoon."
