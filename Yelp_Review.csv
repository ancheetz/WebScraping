0,"I've been here on multiple occasions with groups of 6 up to 30+ people. Bar + has been my choice for karaoke downtown since 2011. As a person that is constantly involved in choir, I enjoy singing, and I'm acquainted with a lot of people that enjoy singing, too. But even seasoned singers can get nervous in front of strangers, and that's why we opt for the privacy of the karaoke rooms of Bar +.First off, the location is very convenient for people who spend most of their time downtown and students. It's only steps away from the busy Dundas station, and a reasonable 20 minute walk away from the St. George campus. However, it might be hard to spot the blink-and-you'll-miss-it door to the stairs leading up to the 2nd floor establishment.There is a bar and a waiting area when you enter, so that you can get your liquid courage while you wait for the rest of your party. The beverage and snack prices are not super expensive. They do allow you to order food to be delivered right to your room.What really sets Bar + apart from other private karaoke bars downtown is how clean it is, and their MASSIVE song collection. I was also happily surprised by the updated tablet system and phone app. The app allows users to bookmark their favorite songs, search by song title and artist, and queue the song directly from the phone to the room via WiFi. No more fighting over the queuing remote! Additionally, they also have a collection of the most recent pop hits in their library, not to mention all the old classics. Finally, all the menus are in English, so finding that perfect song to show off your range will not be a challenge.","I've been coming here for years. Major things it has going for it; location, price and song updates. This is right by the Eaton's Center which is pretty much the smack center of downtown Toronto, easy to get to by ttc or a short walk away. The prices are incredibly fair - you pay based on the room size and duration in multiples of hours. For such a clutch location it'd be reasonable to charge a higher price but the value is really good here. Also, song updates - if a song is a new hit or single from an artist you will most likely see it here - albeit it will be the lyrics only version of the video. The cons - only a slight issue with cleanliness. Some rooms are much cleaner than others, but especially on busy nights we've unfortunately had some rooms where there are stains/spills on the floor or couches, most likely from a previous party. The staff are very helpful, respondent and willing to assist, however unfortunately it cuts into the rental time. When there isn't another party booked right after you, they can sometimes add more time but that isn't always the case, especially on weekend nights.","The go to place for Karaoke in the downtown core, great rooms that range in size to fit small to larger groups. Friendly staff, an unmatched library of songs to choose from, plus reasonably priced drinks.I'm not one for public karaoke singing but private rooms, that's the way to go! I enjoy their tech in the room with easy to use tablets. I would prefer a slightly more noise proof-ness on the walls but volumes can be turned down. They allow you to bring outside food in at no cost, I would like their beer menu to be a little bit more extensive, but this is probably the most fun you can have doing anything in the Yonge and Dundas area.","Bar + karaoke = fun.  Bar + libations + karaoke = funner.Seriously, the times they are a changing.  Just like your quintessential all-you-can-eat made for mass consumption sushi places, the ""book"" is a dinosaur.  It's archaic, legacy, and might as well spell out the prelude to extinction.  What do I mean by this?  Have you gone to a karaoke place and used the ""book""?  You know where maybe songs are in a quasi-organized alphabetical order by song only, not by artist and there's no real index or way of finding what you're looking for?  Some of these books are big, jumbled and eventually obsolete.  Order by artist?  Perhaps not, perhaps but just like Encyclopedia Britannica,  you're left with a stack of pages of that were printed way back when Lotus 123 was the only spreadsheet program and Microsoft Excel wasn't even at inception.While karaoke can be considered fun, looking for codes to songs that you can't find because the book is such a hot mess is not.  Just like the AYCE sushi counterpart printed check lists and a pencil are like the Asian Speak and Spells with trying to punch in song codes.  I'll be one to say that F that technology because having a tablet with photos, search, sorting is so much simpler and being literally at your fingertips is superior supreme.  It's the difference between using a hard copy address book and dialing on a rotary phone versus going to your favorites in contacts and simply tapping a name to make a call.Tablets with a user friendly interface are for the WIN.  Now, if I haven't stressed vehemently enough that I prefer selecting songs by using a tablet let me just come out and say it.  The books, burn them like it's a Handmaid's Tale, like it's the Hunger Games, like it's 1984 because dayummm having a tablet makes me feel like it's 2012 versus 19 something or other when 33rpm meant something.  Oh, Bar + has this by the way which is why I'm completely going off on them having this option.  I like the option can you tell?  Well, can you?Once you go tablet, there's no going back and I seriously mean that.  I can't honestly step into another karaoke place and use that BOOK ever again.  I've been spoiled like my adorable niece and I swear there is simply no going back to the BOOK.  It would be like trying to build the Berlin wall again.  No.  We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.  Yes, that's a song, a Taylor Swift song no doubt but that wasn't the song I tried to sing.  It was my Favorite Taylor Swift song, Sparks Fly which I learned that I can't mentally or physically go down an octave and that it sounds so much better when she's singing it instead of me.  Sume D (aka Miss Congeniality) has a VIP card here which she purchased for some completely nominal amount.  This allowed a small group of 4 of us to book a room at Bar + for an hour and half on a weekday (was it a Tuesday?) and it was barely 8 bucks a piece.  Hello, that was such a good deal.  The room we had was well sized for our group and although we had to fiddle a bit with the main system because some songs were much louder than others, overall it wasn't hard to figure out.  That tablet though... it was along the lines of the Star Trek universe where it felt like we were cave man before and now somebody just dropped a Federation piece of technology on us.  The Prime Directive being violated in this instance is acceptable.Bar + = greater than (can't use those characters here, code you know) *.* karaoke places out there =/= tablets. END","We've had a few party's here. I like the private rooms and the fact that you can bring your own food. For our group of about 12 people, it was a little tight. The location is a bit of a pain to get to from outside the downtown core if you are driving. We were late because of all the traffic. But once we got there, we had fun.The kareoke song list is pretty good although some of the versions were not the original which was kind of lame. Overall it was an entertaining way to spend an hour or two.",Came once for my cousins birthday party and we had a blast. Not only were we able to make reservations for our large group but we were able to bring in our own snacks and cake which was a nice touch.Music selection was also strong and included all the favs so everyone had a blast. Decor and vibe was modern yet classic karaoke bar. Loved it. Would come back!,"We have been here for a few parties now. Located at Yonge and Elm can be a pain if your are driving. There is both street and  lot parking on Elm. The entrance isn't immediately evident. Single door with stairs leading to the second floor. A little dingy going up, leading to bar and small seating area. Rooms will accommodate groups for 10 to 20. Rooms are rented by the hour Good list of music to select from. Loads of fun. Loads","I've been here twice with a large group for a friend's birthday party. She always books the room, so I can't speak to that experience: this review is coming solely as a shy girl showing up to sing.So many pros to this place that make it a superior karaoke experience. First, you get a private room! If you're shy, this is the place you'll let your inner Whitney Houston out. Second, rooms are nice! They have sleek leather seats with the option for ~fancy~ coloured strobe lights that blink to the beat of your song if you wanna get clubby with it! Third, you can bring your own snacks and eat to your heart's content so that you have more energy to keep singing! Fourth, they have a killer catalogue of songs. Never did I think I'd sing an obscure System of a Down song on the same night as a Ludacris jam, but here we are. You get a tablet with all the songs with your room but for the best experience download the app!!Beer is on the expensive side, about $6 for a bottle of premium domestic beer. If you come with a group and split the room cost, the room charge is quite reasonable all things considered. The bathrooms are small with 2 stalls in the ladies room; by the end of the night, they can get a lil gross. Overall, this is a solid establishment and I'd definitely recommend it!","Great service! Technical difficulties were promptly addressed. Excellent music selection! Although would benefit from more music videos, haha. Pricey (50-100$ an hour depending on the size of room, small holding 7ppl) but I would definitely return! Thanks Bar+","Overall a good experience given that we came on the day to get a room for 3 hours. A group of 8 sang to our hearts content and the staff gave us a small room instead since they had no more medium sized rooms. It was a bonus since it ended up being $15 pp (including tip) for the 3 hours and it was perfect size for the group. I did not realize that you can pre-book online as I overheard the staff on the phone asking for a deposit to hold the room.Song selection was pretty good with some new songs and others that I never thought any karaoke would have. Definitely, it was better English song selections for us compared to the other ones nearby and uptown. Drinks are extra with a wide selection of pop, beer and mixed drinks.Initially, the mic was soft and we had to get the staff to adjust the volume manually. Also, the tablet is easy to use to find the song that you want to sing. I would come back next time if my friends wanna join me.","Nice clean place. Fairly well decorated, though if you look closely at the finishes, it's not quite as nice as it initially seems. Regardless, it's a good, comfortable spot.Great sound with the speakers and never had an issue with the mics. About the only technical issue that comes up a little is the change of volume between songs - which can be fairly pronounced at times. That said, I've experienced that everywhere and the volume control is fairly simple.Speaking of the controls, the ipad menu is much easier and faster than the standard Karaoke bibles alongside the 50 button remote. The modern system also seems to allow for more updating, so you'll find a great deal of contemporary hits. For old-school music lovers such as myself, there's still plenty of choices and you'll typically find what you're looking for.I haven't ordered from the bar, but there's about 10 choices for beer available at standard rates. I didn't pay attention to the other options - though they are there.From the pricing, there's about 3 different sized rooms to choose from (and pay for accordingly). One of the rooms almost looked like a mini-lounge that could probably handle 20+ people easily if that's ever in your plans.","Always a good time, love that there's different room sizes to accommodate any size of group",This place is one of the better Karoake bars in Toronto. They have a pretty extensive playlist and their booths are cozy and intimate for a group of friends. They are quite busy though so I would encourage anyone to book in advance. I also have to state that the microphones can create a lot of unnecessary feedback.,"Had my birthday celebration here and as expected, everything went really well! The large room was much more spacious than I thought - when I told the worker then I will probably have more than 30 people, she reassured me that it will fit everyone comfortably. I had about 35 guests and it fit everyone perfectly! Just like my last visit, the songs are also VERY updated!! There was also 2 TVs in the room which was really convenient since there were plenty of people standing, leaving and coming back in. Bottle service was also really good - the prices are A LOT better than the clubs that I ended up getting 4 bottles right away LOL! My friend even ended up getting another bottle because prices were so good!! I also love that Bar+ allows you to bring your own food - my friends went crazy coming back with McDonalds haha. HIGHLY recommend as always!!","Went there yesterday night as a last minute thing for my friend's birthday and had a really fun time! The decor was really nice and doesn't look as run down as some karaoke places that are Downtown or Korea Town. Music selection was also very good and up to date! Choosing songs was easy and self explanatory. I'd always have a bit of trouble in the beginning at other karaoke places but not here! The room rate was very good - $25 for 5 people & not to mention drinks are cheap compared to a lot of other places! My friends and I ordered a loot of drinks last night LOL Lastly a BIG SHOUT OUT TO JASON AT THE BAR!! He was amazing and made our whole experience even better! Even saw how happy other guests were with Jason! You the best, Jason ~ Will definitely come back!!","This place is so cute!! Location is kinda sketch on top of a Swiss Chalet lmao but the lady who worked there was so sweet!! Literally the best! I think she was blonde if my memory serves me right. She was so cute. The rooms were nice, not bad, nice couches, the karaoke videos were taken off youtube so that was funny. 1 star off just because I wish they had more songs. Like different cultures  too. Maybe some Bollywood songs would be nice. So yeah, that's the only thing.Nice that they had mic covers, and the price for the room was so cheap!!! We were only 3 people and the room could fit up to 5 and it was pretty big for a ""small room"". It was only $30 an hour!!! Amazing overall :)","I haven't a clue how this place has such rave reviews. I have traveled to all major cities around the world and always venture off to karaoke. This was by far my biggest disappointment. I paid double for what I pay in New York City to enjoy an hour and thought to myself ""maybe they have technology or some other extras i haven't seen before"". NOPE. The mics kept cutting in and out, the tablet they use to key in the song selection is delayed and of poor quality, the words displayed on the screen were off beat and there's no way to order service in the room. If you want to order a drink you have to leave the room and order at the bar (taking time away from the expensive hourly rate). 15mins before my session was over there was a huge notification blocking the words on the screen saying ""session will be disabled"". They said it was an error and as I continued during my last song, the same notification came on. Call me dramatic but if I'm in the middle of passionately belting out a song I most likely saved for last because it's my best, couldn't you interrupt me in a less invasive way?","Disclaimer: I'm adding all my google reviews to yelp - so this one is from last November.Had made a reservation for 3 hrs last night, but we were running a bit late due to some pretty horrendous traffic. Called staff to let them know and they were very cool about it. Service is good, rooms were clean and my friends had a blast. You're also allowed to bring in outside food, so I had a pizza delivered. They also only charged us for 2hrs instead of 3 which I was fully prepared to pay for even though we were an hour late. Good customer service,  would recommend. Thanks for a fun night!","Rude host. It was a busy night and we didn't have a reservation.It looked like only one person was working. After waiting a while, we asked the staff how long the wait would  be for a room. She replied ""i need to do other things, You  can wait"" in an annoyed tone.WTF kind of service is this.",This place I found to be of great value per hour. The equipment is easy to use and the staff were on hand to help out. Good variety of drinks at the bar also
